            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The name and memory of that Apoſtolick and ſingularly godly and faithful ſervant of JESUS CHRIST <hi>M. John Welſch</hi> (who now is attending his Maſters work in the Upper-Houſe without wearying, night and day) is ſo precious in the Church of CHRIST, that the reviſing &amp; republiſhing of any of his works (who praiſe him in the gate) will, I hope, be very acceptable to all the learned and godly, eſpecially this ſubſequent Treatiſe, wherein many of the greateſt and weightieſt points of Controverſie betwixt us and Papiſts, are learnedly and ſolidly debated, and the truth of our Doctrine evidently demonſtrated; and the error, ſuperſtition, and idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> excellently anatomized and ſolidly refuted; eſpecially in ſuch a time as this, when Popery ſo much every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth, and the Pope and his Agents are moſt active and
<pb facs="tcp:106559:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> diligent, uſing all-means to get their deadly wound cured, ſending over to theſe Nations dayly ſwarms of Prieſts and Jeſuits, with books, beads, medals, and the like Romiſh traſh, thereby to ſeduce the poor people, who are in great hazard, partly through their ignorance of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies betwixt us and Papiſts, partly through the lamentable decay of zeal againſt Antichriſt, and love to the truth; partly through the ſad diviſions and diſtractions that are among our ſelves, whereby the poor people are ſorely brangled and tempted to <hi>Scepteiiſm,</hi> and is made uſe of by Prieſts and Jeſuits, as a ſtrong motive to perſwade them to <hi>Popery,</hi> although there be far greater diviſions among Papiſts, then among us, as I have elſewhere demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
            <p>We ſhal not detain you long in the entry, but only ſpeak a little of the Author, and of this Treatiſe, and the cauſes that moved the reviving and republiſhing thereof at this time.</p>
            <p>The now triumphing and glorified Author needeth none of our commendation, he being among the ſpirits of juſt men before the throne, and his memory being deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly very precious in the Church of Chriſt: But becauſe the lives of godly men are uſeful for imitation, we ſhal give a ſhort deſcription of his life. He was deſcended of an ancient and reſpective family, being a ſon of an ancient houſe of the name of <hi>Welſch</hi> in <hi>Nithſdale.</hi> He was born a little after that bleſſed work of Reformation began in <hi>Scotland:</hi> and being trained up at Schools, he profited very much, ſo that he was excellently accompliſhed in all kind of literature, and eminent for piety and zeal for the Kingdom of Chriſt: And being called to the Miniſtery of the Goſpel about the year 1588. at the town of <hi>Kirkubright,</hi> he was moſt diligent and laborious in preaching, catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, viſiting the ſick, and diſputing and convincing of
<pb facs="tcp:106559:3"/> Papiſts, which that Countrey abounded with. And his labors were ſingularly bleſſed of God; for many were brought by his Miniſtery, to ſee the error, ſuperſtition and idolatry of Popery, and to embrace the truth: and many were really converted to God, and others were edified and built up, confirmed, comforted, and ſtrenthened; ſo that he, as a ſhining and burning light, did inlighten that whole Countrey, who at that time was in many places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitut of Paſtors. After he had remained there ſeveral years, the General Aſſembly thought fit to tranſport him to <hi>Air,</hi> as a Town of greater note, and more populous, where he was moſt aſſiduous and diligent in the work of the Miniſtery: for he preached not only twiſe on the Lords day, but alſo twiſe on every day of the week, from nine to ten in the morning, and from four to five at night, where the Lord wonderfully bleſſed his labors; for both in <hi>Air,</hi> and in the Countrey about, many were converted by him: ſome of whom were as eminent and lively Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as readily have been known of latter times. After he had continued in the work of the Miniſtery ſeveral years at <hi>Air,</hi> he was commiſſioned by the Presbytery, with ſome other of his brethren, to keep the Aſſembly indicted at <hi>Aberdene, anno</hi> 1605. for which he, with <hi>M. John Forbes, M. Andrew Duncan, M. John Sharp, M. Robert Dury,</hi> and <hi>M. Alexander Strachan,</hi> were arraigned, impriſoned, and at length baniſhed, <hi>anno</hi> 1606. whereupon he went to <hi>France,</hi> and in a very ſhort time learned the <hi>French</hi> tongue, and acquired ſuch a facility therein, as was thought ſtrange by theſe who knew it. He was called to the Miniſtery in <hi>S. John d' Angely,</hi> a Proteſtant town in <hi>France,</hi> where his Miniſtery was much bleſſed with ſucceſs. But the Civil Warrs ariſing while he was there, that City was beſieged on the Proteſtant intereſt. <hi>M. Welſch</hi> did much encourage the people, and told them that their adverſaries ſhould not
<pb facs="tcp:106559:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> prevail. But in proceſs of time, the town was ſore ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ready to be taken, the enemy having raiſed a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and by a cloſe approach, had made a great breach in the wall. <hi>M. Welſch</hi> hearing thereof (leſt the people ſhould be diſcouraged and faint) went himſelf with the Canonier up the walls, and deſired he ſhould charge ſuch a piece of Canon, and ſhoot, for GOD ſhould direct that ſhot, and cauſe it to proſper; which accordingly did, to the aſtoniſhment of on-lookers, diſmount that battery: and the Lord ſo ordered things after, that the King did parley on favorable terms with the City, and did only him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his Court come in, without doing any violence.</p>
            <p>Upon the LORDS day thereafter, ſome of the godly in that place, fearing <hi>M. Welſch</hi> his hazard, did ſeriouſly deal with him, that he would forbear to go forth and preach, the Court being there: But he would by no means be hindered, ſhowing them he would adventure to preach the Word to his people, and truſt the Lord with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned himſelf: Therefore he went forth and preached, having a very great Auditory, both of friends, and others, who came upon the fame of ſuch a man. But in time of Sermon, a great man of the Court, with ſome of the Kings own guard, was ſent to bring him forthwith before the King: and whilſt he was entering the Church, which had ſome difficulty, by reaſon of the multitude, <hi>M. Welſch</hi> did turn himſelf toward that entry, and deſired the people to give way to one of the great Peers of <hi>France</hi> that was coming in. But after whilſt he was coming near the Pulpit to execute his Commiſſion, he did with great authority ſpeak to him before all the people; and in the Name of his Maſter JESUS CHRIST, charged him, that he would not diſturb the worſhip of GOD. Wherewith he was ſo affrighted, that he fell a ſhaking, yea was forced to crutch down, and make no further trouble. Sermon being
<pb facs="tcp:106559:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> ended, <hi>M. Welſch</hi> with much ſubmiſſion, went to the King, who was then greatly incenſed, and with a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning countenance, asked, What he was? And how he durſt preach Hereſie ſo near his perſon, and with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy carry himſelf? To which with due reverence, bowing himſelf, he did anſwer: <hi>I am, Sir, the ſervant and Miniſter of JESUS CHRIST, whoſe truth I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched this day: which if your Majesty rightly knew, ye would have judged it your duty to have come your ſelf and heard. And for my doctrine, I did this day preach theſe three truths to your people. Firſt, that man is fallen, and by nature in a loſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yea, by his own power and abilities, is not able to help himſelf from that eſtat. Secondly, that there is no ſalvation, or deliverance from wrath, by our own merits; but by JESUS CHRIST, and his merit alone. Thirdly, I did alſo preach this day, the juſt liberties of the Kingdom of France, that your Majeſty oweth obedience to Chriſt only, who is the Head of the Church: and that the Pope, as he is an enemy to Chriſt and his truth, ſo alſo to the Kings of the earth, whom he keepeth under ſlavery to his uſurped power.</hi> Whereat the King for a time keeping ſilence, with great aſtoniſhment turned to ſome about him, and ſaid, Surely, this is a man of GOD. Yea, after did commune with him, and with great reſpect diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed him. The next year, the differences betwixt the King and Proteſtants growing greater, the City was again beſieged. <hi>M. Welſch</hi> intreated the Citizens to make peace with the King; for God had a controverſie with them, for their unthankfulneſs, and not walking anſwerably to the Goſpel, therefore he was not with them as formerly, but had given them up to their enemies: and if they ſtood out, their City ſhould be taken. But the City not hearkening to him, was taken, and in part ſacked. At which time the King paſſed a ſolemn order, that none ſhould in the leaſt wrong <hi>M. Welſch,</hi> nor any thing that belonged to him,
<pb facs="tcp:106559:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> under higheſt pains: and ſaid to him, as <hi>Nebuzaradan</hi> to <hi>Jeremiah, All the land is before thee, whither it ſeemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.</hi> But <hi>M. Welſch</hi> being grown exceedingly infirm in his body, and the Phyſicians adviſing that only his native air could help him, choiſed to go over to <hi>England,</hi> whereupon the King granted him a ſafe-conduct. So he came over to <hi>London,</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a certain ſpace; but not being permitted to return to <hi>Scotland,</hi> his ſickneſs encreaſed, and he died. During the time of his ſickneſs, he was ſo filled and overcome with the ſenſible enjoyment of GOD, that he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times over-heard in prayer, to have theſe words, <hi>LORD, hold thy hand, it is enough; thy ſervant it a clay veſſel, and can hold no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was a man, for piety, converſe, and communion with GOD, moſt ſingular and rare. <hi>M. Rutherfurd</hi> in his Epiſtle prefixed to his <hi>Survey of Antinomianiſm,</hi> ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that from the witneſſes of his life, he had this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that of every twenty-four hours, he gave uſually eight to prayer, if other neceſſary and urgent duties did not hinder; Yea, he ſpent many dayes and nights which he ſet apart, in faſting and prayer, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church, and the ſufferings of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches abroad. He uſed even in the coldeſt win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nights, to riſe for prayer (as the Author <hi>of the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Scripture</hi> teſtifieth) and oft times his wife hath riſen to ſeek after him, where he hath been found lying on the ground, weeping, and wreſtling with the LORD; yea, ſome times would have been much of the night alone, in the Church of <hi>Air,</hi> on that account. One time eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, his wife finding him overcharged with grief, he told her, he had that to preſs him which ſhe had not, the ſouls of three thouſand people to anſwer for, whilſt he knew not how it was with many of them. And at another
<pb facs="tcp:106559:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> time whilſt ſhe found him alone, his ſpirit almoſt overchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with anguiſh and grief, upon her ſerious enquiry, ſaid, That the times which were to come on <hi>Scotland</hi> were heavy and ſad, though ſhe ſhould not ſee them, and this for the contempt of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>While he was in <hi>France,</hi> a Frier travelling through the Countrey came to his houſe, and <hi>M. Welſch</hi> being very hoſpital, permitted him to ſtay all night. The Friers bed being not far from <hi>M. Welſch</hi> his chamber, heard a noyſe, with many deep ſighs and groans all night, which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been an evil ſpirit, and therefore aroſe early in the morning, and would needs be gone: a <hi>Scots</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-man being in the houſe, and ſeeing the Frier troubled, enquired what the matter meant that he would be gone ſo ſoon? He anſwered, he would not ſtay in a <hi>Huguenots</hi> houſe any longer, for they had converſe with evil ſpirits. The Gentle-man underſtanding the matter, told him, that it was <hi>M. Welſch,</hi> whoſe ordinary it was to pray all night, and deſired him to ſtay the next night, and he ſhould ſee the truth thereof: which accordingly he did, and was ſo much aſtoniſhed at <hi>M. Welſch</hi> his piety, that he forſook Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and embraced the Reformed Religion.</p>
            <p>As he converſed with GOD, and dwelt in the Mount by prayer and wreſtling with GOD, night and day (for he uſed to ſay, He wondered how a Chriſtian could ly in bed all night without riſing to ſpend ſome of the night in prayer and praiſe) ſo he was admitted to very intimat nearneſs with him: and to ſpeak with reverence, put upon his ſecrets, ſo that he had very many things revealed to him, both concerning the Church and Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and concerning particular places and perſons; ſeveral inſtances thereof are recorded.</p>
            <p n="1">I. In his letter to my Lady <hi>Fleeming,</hi> he fore-telleth the judgement coming on <hi>Scotland:</hi> for he thus ſpeaketh:
<pb facs="tcp:106559:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>Alace, for the Kingdom of Scotland: my testimony doth not differ from that of many before this time, who ſaid, that the judgement of Scotland ſhould be blood. This Kingdom ſhal be drowned in blood: A forbiſhed and gliſtering ſword is dight, and already drawn out of the ſheath, which ſhal not return until it be made drunk with the blood of the men within this Land. Firſt, the heavy inteſtin ſword, and then the fury of a ſtranger. O doleful Scotland! well were he that were removed far from thee, that his eyes might not ſee, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>r his ears hear all the evils that are to come upon thee. Neither the ſtrong man by his ſtrength, nor the rich man by his riches, nor the Noble by his blood, ſhal be delivered from the judgement. There is a great ſacrifice to be made in Bozra, in thee, O Scotland! of the blood of all ſorts in the Land. Ephraim ſhal conſume Manaſſe, and Manaſſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim. Brother against brother, and every man in the judgement of the LORD, ſhal be armed to thruſt his ſword in the ſide of his neighbor, and all for the contempt of the moſt glorious Goſpel, and that blood which was offered to thee, O Scotland! in ſo plentiful a manner, that the like thereof hath not been offered to any Nation; therefore thy judgement ſhal be the greater.</hi> The fulfilling whereof (at leaſt in part) hath ſince been very ſenſible, and is known by many alive, who had that letter long before the late troubles did begin.</p>
            <p n="2">II. On a certain night being under an extraordinary preſſure of ſpirit to go and powr forth his heart to GOD, he left his wife in bed, and going out to a garden, ſpent moſt of the night in that exerciſe; but his wife weary, at laſt went to ſeek for him: but miſſing him in his ordinary place, went into other gardens, by ſuch paſſages as ſhe knew; at laſt ſhe heard a voyce, and drawing near to it, could but hear him ſpeak a few words, but with great force and fervency, mixed and accompanied with floods of tears, which were theſe, <hi>O GOD, wilt thou not give me Scotland? O GOD, wilt thou not give me Scotland.</hi> She
<pb facs="tcp:106559:6"/> being weary and afraid to interrupt him, went home, and heard not the cloſe. At laſt he came home, and reente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to his bed, his wife began to reprove his unmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his own body, then asked him, what was he ſaying? for ſhe told ſhe heard him. Well, ſaid he, ye had better have been in your bed; but ſince ye heard, I tell you, I have endured a great fight for <hi>Scotland</hi> this night, and hardly could I get a remnant reſerved, yet he will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
            <p n="3">III. After this he aroſe another night, but went not out of doors: but in a chamber he travelled and groaned ſo, as his wife impatient did riſe ſeveral times calling him to bed: but he waited his time. And when he came, ſhe began a modeſt expoſtulation with him for tarrying. <hi>Hold thy peace</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>it will be well with us; but I ſhal never preach another preaching in Air.</hi> And having fallen aſleep, before he awaked, the meſſenger was come, who by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand carryed him priſoner to the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. When he was priſoner in the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for holding the Aſſembly of <hi>Aberdene.</hi> The Lord <hi>Ochil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie</hi> being at that time Captain of the Caſtle, cauſed <hi>M. Welſch</hi> to ſup with him one night in the Caſtle (being related to him, for <hi>M. Welſch</hi> mother in law, <hi>M. Knoxs</hi> wife was his ſiſter) where were alſo ſeveral other Gentle-men, and among them a Popiſh youth ſate toward the lower end of the table. <hi>M. Welſch</hi> being by the Captain ſet at the upper end, entertained the company with grave and edifying diſcourſe, which all delighted to hear, ſave the young Papiſt, who with laughter and deriſion labored to ſilence him, which was little regarded by <hi>M. Welſch.</hi> But after ſupper while the gueſts ſate a little, this youth ſtood up at the lower end of the table, and while M. <hi>Welſch</hi> proceeded from grave to gracious entertainment of them at table, the youth came to that hight of inſolency, as with
<pb facs="tcp:106559:7"/> the finger to point at him, and with the face to make flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting grimaces, whereby he grieved the holy man, ſo as on a ſudden he was forced to a ſilence.</p>
            <p>The whole company who heard him with delight, were ſilent with him. Within a little, M. <hi>Welſch,</hi> as moved by the Spirit of GOD, broke forth into theſe words: <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-men, the Spirit of GOD is provoked againſt us, and I ſhal intreat you not to be afraid to ſee what GOD ſhal do among you before you riſe from the table; for he will ſmite ſome one of you with death before you go home.</hi> All were ſilently aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, waiting to ſee the iſſue with fear: and while every man feared himſelf, except the inſolent youth, he fell down dead ſuddenly at the foot of the table, to ſhow the power of GODS jealouſie againſt the mockers of his Spirit, and the offers of his grace.</p>
            <p n="5">V. One day while M. <hi>Welſch</hi> looked out at his chamber window in the Caſtle, he hapned to ſee the Captain, and called unto him ſaying, God ſave you, my Lord. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain acknowledging his neglect, and asking for M. <hi>Welſch</hi> welfare, deſired to know how he might ſerve him. <hi>In no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> (ſaid M. <hi>Welſch) if you be well, except you would carry my petition to his Majeſty, intreating for liberty to preach the Goſpel.</hi> I willingly will (ſaid the Captain) therefore ſend it to me. Nay, ſaid M. <hi>Welſch,</hi> I am your kinſman; I love you ſo well, as to warn you not to take it in charge, except you reſolve to deal truly in delivering it, and getting me an anſwer. I ſhal bear the blame, ſaid the Captain, if I do it not. I beſeech you, my Lord, ſaid the other, under-take it not, except you mind to do it; for the hazard is great. Well, <hi>Ochiltry</hi> takes it, but not coming in an opportune ſeaſon (for he came when the King was paſſionatly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on another occaſion) he thought not fit then to give it: and as at that time he deferred, ſo thereafter he negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and at laſt quite forgot to deliver it at all. For which
<pb facs="tcp:106559:7"/> his heart ſmiting him, he durſt hardly be ſeen of M. <hi>Welſch</hi> for three moneths. Yet conſcience forgetting as well as he, he came to the ſame place where M. <hi>Welſch</hi> at firſt called him: and now M. <hi>Welſch</hi> asked how he did, and what was become of his petition? The Captain ſurpriſed, anſwered, I delivered it to his Majeſty, but he was in a paſſion, and it ſeems it hath fallen by, for I have not gotten an anſwer. Nay, my Lord, ſaid M. <hi>Welſch,</hi> you ſhould not lie to God and to me; I know you delivered it not: I am ſory, My Lord, for your lot. I warned you not to be falſe to God; and now I tell you, God ſhal take your eſtat and honors in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſhal give them to your neighbor, and this in your own time. This troubled the Lord <hi>Ochil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,</hi> and came truly to paſs: for he being the eldeſt ſon of the good Lord <hi>Ochiltrie,</hi> a Reformer, was forced in his own time to quite all, and give both eſtat and honors to <hi>James</hi> the ſon of Captain <hi>James</hi> the ſecond brother, who was the laſt of that houſe.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. While he was Miniſter at <hi>Air,</hi> the plague was ſore in the Countrey, but no infection was in the Town: but it came to paſs that two men coming with packs of cloth to the Town from a neighboring place, where there was yet no ſuſpicion thereof. The ſentry on the Bridge held them out, notwithſtanding they had a paſs while the Magiſtrat came; who though he could not diſprove their paſs, yet would not permit them to enter the Town, till he ſent for M. <hi>Welſch.</hi> So the Bailly bids them disburden their beaſts, till he conſidered what was to be done. A little after, M. <hi>Welſch</hi> coming, the Bailly ſaith to him, Sir, here are men come from ſuch a place, we have heard of no plague there; beſides they have a paſs from known men: What ſhal we do? M. <hi>Welſch</hi> made no anſwer, but uncovering his head, ſtood in the midſt of the company that followed him, and having his eyes directed to
<pb facs="tcp:106559:8"/> heaven (yet ſpeaking nothing) near half a quarter of an hour; at laſt ſaid, <hi>Bailly, cauſe theſe men put on their packs again, and be gone: for if GOD be in heaven, the plague of GOD is in theſe packs.</hi> Theſe men returned, and opened their packs at <hi>Cumnock,</hi> and it was obſerved that ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion was therein, that all the people of that Village died; there was not a man left to bury the dead.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. While he was in priſon, <hi>John Stewart</hi> an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Chriſtian wo lived at <hi>Air,</hi> being come to viſit him, found him in a more then ordinary way troubled, and ſad; and upon his enquiry thereanent, he ſaith, <hi>John,</hi> ye ſhould not be here, go home to <hi>Air,</hi> for the plague of GOD is broken up in that place, and cauſe <hi>Hew Kennedy,</hi> Proveſt of that Town (who was alſo a very ſingular Chriſtian) convean the people to the ſtreets, and pray together, and the Lord ſhal hear <hi>Hew Kennedy,</hi> and remove the ſtroke. This at firſt did ſomething aſtoniſh the ſaid <hi>John,</hi> and put him to queſtion its truth, having ſo lately come out of that place; but at his return found it ſo, and accordingly in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing it fell out as the man of GOD had ſhewed. Theſe inſtances are recorded <hi>in the fulfilling of the Scriptures,</hi> to which I add one no leſs true then the reſt, it is this.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. While M. <hi>VVelſch</hi> was Miniſter at <hi>Air,</hi> there was much profanation of the LORDS Day committed, by reaſon of great confluence of people (at a Gentle-mans houſe about eight miles diſtance from <hi>Air</hi>) to the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball, and other games and paſtimes, whereupon M. <hi>VVelſch</hi> did ſeveral times write to the Gentle-man, deſiring him to ſuppreſs the profanation of the LORDS Day at his houſe; but he not loving to be called a <hi>Puritan,</hi> ſlighted it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore M. <hi>VVelſch</hi> came on a day to his gate, and called for the Gentle-man, who coming to him, he told him that he had a meſſage from GOD to him, to ſhow him, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſlighted the adviſe given him from the LORD,
<pb facs="tcp:106559:8"/> and would not reſtrain the profanation of the LORDS Day committed in his bounds, therefore the LORD would caſt him out of his houſe and eſtat, and none of his poſterity ſhould ever enjoy it. Which came to paſs; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Gentle-man was in a very good external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition at that time, yet from that day forward all things croſſed him, while at length he was neceſſitat to ſell his eſtat: and while he was giving the buyer poſſeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he told before his wife and children, with tears, that he had found M. <hi>VVelſch</hi> a true Prophet. This was rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Gentle-mans own ſon, a godly and reverent Miniſter, who was preſent when his father told it with tears.</p>
            <p>He longed much to be in heaven, and to be rid of a body of death, as witneſſeth among others, theſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in that fore-cited letter: <hi>My deſire to remain here is not great, knowing that ſo long as I am in this houſe of clay, I am abſent from the LORD: and if it were diſſolved, I look for a building not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. In this I groan, deſiring to be clothed upon with my houſe which is in heaven: If ſo be that being clothed, I ſhal not be found na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. For I that am within this tabernacle, do oft times groan, and ſigh within my ſelf, being oft times burdened; not that I would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be ſwallowed up of life. I long to eat the fruit of that tree which is planted in the midst of the Paradiſe of GOD; and to drink of the pure river clear as crystal that runs through the ſtreets of that new Jeruſalem. I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhal ſtand at the laſt day on the earth: and that after my skin worms destroy my body, yet in my fleſh ſhal I ſee GOD; whom I ſhal ſee for my ſelf, and not another for me. And mine eyes ſhal behold him, though my reins be conſumed within me. I long to be refreſhed with the ſouls of them that are under the altar, who were ſlain for the Word of GOD, and the
<pb facs="tcp:106559:9"/> teſtimony they held: And to have theſe long white robes given me, that I may walk in white with theſe glorious Saints, who have waſhed their garments, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Why ſhould I think it a ſtrange thing to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from this place to that wherein is my hope, my joy, my crown, my eldeſt brother, my Head, my Father, my Comforter, and all the glorified Saints; and where the ſong of Moſes and the Lamb is ſung joyfully. Where we ſhal not be compelled to ſit by the rivers of Babylon, nor to hing up our harps on willow trees; but ſhal take them, and ſing the new Halelujah, Bleſſing, honor, glory and power to him that ſitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever. What is under this old vault of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and in this old worn earth, which is under the bondage of corruption, groaning and travelling in pain; and as it were, ſtill ſhooting out the head, looking, waiting and longing for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the ſons of GOD? VVhat is there, I ſay, that ſhould make me remain here? I expect that new heaven, and that new earth, where righteouſneſs dwelleth, wherein I ſhal reſt for evermore. I look to get entry at the new Jeruſalem: at one of theſe twelve gates, whereupon are written the names of the twelve Tribes of the children of Iſrael. I know CHRIST JESUS hath prepared rowm for me: why may I not then with boldneſs in his blood, ſtep in unto that glory, where my Head and LORD hath gone before me. JESUS CHRIST is the door and the Porter, who then ſhal hold me out? VVill he let them periſh for whom he hath died? VVill he let that poor ſheep be plucked out of his hand, for whom he hath laid down his life? VVho ſhal condemn the man whom GOD hath justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? VVho ſhal lay any thing to the charge of the man for whom CHRIST hath died, or rather riſen again? I know I have grievouſly tranſgreſſed; but where ſin aboundeth; grace ſuperaboundeth. I know my ſins are red as ſcarlet and crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet the red blood of CHRIST my LORD, can make me as white as ſnow, as wool. VVhom have I in heaven but him?
<pb facs="tcp:106559:9"/> Or whom deſire I in earth beſide him? O thou the fairest among the children of men, the light of the Gentils, the glory of the Jews, the life of the dead, the joy of Angels and Saints. My ſoul panteth to be with thee.

Thou camest to ſeek and ſave that which is loſt. Thou ſeeking me, haſt found me: and now being found by thee, I hope, O LORD, thou wilt not let me periſh. I deſire to be with thee, and do long for the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy bleſſed preſence, and joy of thy countenance. Thou the only good Shepherd, art full of grace and truth: therefore I trust thou wilt not thruſt me out of the door of thy preſence and grace. The Law was given by Moſes, but grace and truth by thee. VVho ſhal ſeparat me from thy love? Shal tribulation or diſtreſs, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword? Nay: in all theſe things I am more then a conqueror, through thy Majeſty that hath loved me. For I am perſwaded, that neither death nor life, Principalities nor Powers, nor hight nor depth, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor any other creature, is able to ſeparat me from the love of thy Majeſty, w ich is in CHRIST JESUS my LORD. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe not to die with thee, that I may live with thee. I refuſe not to ſuffer with thee, that I may rejoyce with thee. Shal not all things be pleaſant to me, which may be my last ſtep, by which or upon which, I may come unto thee. When ſhal I be ſatiat with thy face? When ſhal I be drunk with thy pleaſures? Come, LORD JESUS, and tarry not. The Spirit ſaith, Come: the Bride ſaith, Come. Even ſo, LORD JESUS, come quickly, and tarry not. Why ſhould the multitude of mine iniquities, or the greatneſs of them affright me? Why ſhould I faint in this mine adverſity to be with thee? The greater ſinner I have been, the greater glory will thy grace be to me unto all eternity. Oh! unſpeakable joy! endleſs, infinit and

O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created Love! Beginning without beginning, and ending with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end! Thou art my glory, my joy, and my gain, and my crown. Thou haſt ſet me under thy ſhadow with great delight, and thy fruit is ſweet unto my taſte. Thou haſt brought me into thy banqueting-houſe, and placed me in thine orchard. Stay me with thy flagons, and comfort me with thine apples: for I am ſick, and my ſoul is wounded with thy love. Behold, thou art fair, my Love: Behold, thou art fair, thou haſt doves eyes. Behold, thou art fair, my Love; yea pleaſant alſo: our bed is green. The beams of our houſe are Cedars, and our raſters are of firr. How fair and how pleaſant art thou! O Love for delights! my heart is raviſhed with thee. O when ſhal I ſee thy face? How long will thou delay to be to me as a Roe, or a young Hart, leaping upon the mountains, and skipping upon the hills. As a bundle of myrrh be thou to me, and ly all night between my breaſts. Becauſe of the ſavor of thy good oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thy name is as oyntment powred out; therefore deſire I to go out of the deſert, and through to the place where thou ſitteſt at thy repoſe, and where thou makes thy flocks to rest at noon. When ſhal I be filled with thy love? Certainly, if a man knew how precious it were, he would count all things droſs and dung to gain it. I would long for that ſcaffold, or that ax, or that cord, that might be to me that laſt ſtep of this my weariſom jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to go to thee my LORD. Thou who knowſt the meaning of the ſpirit, give anſwer to the ſpeaking, ſighing, and groaning of the ſpirit. Thou who haſt inflamed my heart to ſpeak to thee in this ſilent, yet love-language of ardent and fervent deſires, ſpeak again unto my heart, and anſwer my deſirs, which thou haſt made me ſpeak to thee. O Death! where is thy ſting? O grave! where is thy victory? The ſting of Death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law: but thanks be to GOD that giveth me the
<pb facs="tcp:106559:10"/> victory through JESUS CHRIST. What can be troubleſome to me, ſince my LORD looks upon me with ſo amiable a countenance? And how greatly do I long for theſe embracements of my LORD? O that he would kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth: for his love is better then wine.

            <p>As he was extraordinary in prayer, ſo he was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly diligent in the reſt of his Maſters Work: For (as I was aſſured by an old reverend and godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who knew the truth thereof) he preached twiſe every week day, from nine to ten in the morning, and from four to five at night, beſide his work on the LORDS Day, and catechiſing and viſiting of families, and of the ſick.</p>

Believe me, when the impreſſion of that is upon my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, I cannot (although I most willingly would) care for, or eſteem the countenance of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was moſt zealous and tender of all the truths of GOD, and ſtudied to the utmoſt of his power, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Kingdom and intereſt of CHRIST; not eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his life dear to him for the cauſe of CHRIST; yea, accounting it his greateſt honor to ſuffer for him and his truth; witneſs theſe words of his in the fore-cited let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>VVho am I that he ſhould firſt have called me, and then conſtitut me a Miniſter of glad tydings of the Goſpell of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion theſe ſixteen years already, and now laſt of all to be a ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer for his cauſe and Kingdom? &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſhined moſt brightly as a ſtar of the firſt magnitude in <hi>Kirkubright</hi> and <hi>Air</hi> the ſpace of ſixteen years, and in <hi>France</hi> about twelve or thirteen years; how long he lived after he came to <hi>England,</hi> I cannot learn: but I ſuppoſe it was not very long: For the ſad caſe of the Churches of <hi>France, Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> brake his heart. His wife was a very eminently godly woman, the daughter of <hi>John
<pb facs="tcp:106559:11"/> Knox,</hi> our famous Reformer. He had two ſons that came to maturity, one whereof was a Doctor of Phyſick, the other, to wit, M. <hi>Joſias,</hi> was a very faithful and eminent Miniſter of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral of his Sermons in manuſcripts in the hands of many: It is a great loſs that theſe candles ſhould be hid under buſhels, and not ſet on candleſticks.</p>
            <p>As concerning this Treatiſe, it is both learned, ſolid, clear, and eaſie to be underſtood by very ordinary capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and the greateſt and weightieſt points of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie are handled therein (as concerning <hi>the Church, the Maſs, Antichriſt, Justification by Faith, the merit of works, the Judge of Controverſies,</hi> and ſeveral other very weighty points of Controverſie) ſo learnedly, ſolidly, and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly, that now for the ſpace of ſeventy years, none ever did attempt to make a reply thereto.</p>
            <p>We need not detain you longer in ſhowing reaſons that moved us to republiſh this Treatiſe at this time: for the great increaſe of Popery, and ignorance of the people of this Countrey, is reaſon ſufficient for publiſhing Treatiſes of this kind; eſpecially ſuch an one as this, which is prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to other Treatiſes of this nature, on ſeveral accounts. Firſt, it handles both convincingly, clearly, and yet briefly, the moſt weighty points of Controverſie betwixt us and Papiſts; whereas other Treatiſes generally, either handle only ſome one or two heads, or elſe they are ſo volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, that common people neither can have money to buy, or time to read them. 2. The Author ſpent much time in praying for a bleſſing on this work, and therefore we may expect a bleſſing on it. 3. The whole Treatiſe ſavors of much piety and zeal, eſpecially the Epiſtle to the Reader: where is laid out to our ſerious conſideration, GODS goodneſs to us on the one hand, and our unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerableneſs to him on the other, with the Authors fears,
<pb facs="tcp:106559:12"/> leſt the Goſpel be removed from us, if we do not repent, and reform. The conſideration whereof will undoubtedly have great influence on a gracious ſoul, to ſtir him up to mourn and lament for the ſins of the Land, and deal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly for the LORDS abiding with us. I know not any thing more uſeful (through GODS bleſſing) for ſtirring us up and awaking us out of our ſecurity, in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and ſtupid generation, then the ſerious conſideration of the things held out in that Epiſtle. Was our provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo great ſeventy years ago, that the godly and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Author expected nothing but the removeal of our candleſtick, except we did repent? And what can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected now, but the powring forth of wrath to the utmoſt on us, except ſpeedy and ſerious repentance prevent it, ſeeing GOD out of his infinit long-ſuffering and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, hath continued the Goſpel with us to this day, and we have multiplied our provocations above the iniquities of our Fathers, as if they had been ſmal things? We have exceedingly ſurmounted them, notwithſtanding that our light hath been greater, and our mercies mo then theirs were. O if the conſideration of theſe things would lead us to repentance!</p>
            <p>That the reading of this Treatiſe might be leſs tedious, and you may more eaſily take it up, I have divided the ſame in Sections, annexing a title to each Section. And becauſe the Section concerning the Maſs, did agree to be placed after the Section concerning Tranſubſtantiation, we have tranſpoſed it, and placed it there. I intended to have annexed thereto, <hi>An anſwer to H. T. his Manual of Controverſies, printed anno</hi> 1671. and ſent into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey for ſeducing of poor ſouls: but becauſe it would have cauſed the Book to ſwel to a Volume. I forbare, intending (if the LORD will) to publiſh it ſhortly: and in the mean time I have annexed, A Diſcovery of the bloody
<pb facs="tcp:106559:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> and treaſonable principles and practiſes of Papiſts; that all may ſee that not only Papiſts are Hereticks and Idolaters; but alſo bloody Traitors and incendiaries, unworthy to live in any Chriſtian Kingdom or Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>As it was the deſign of the bleſſed Author in writing and publiſhing this Treatiſe at firſt, to confirm the weak, eſtabliſh the wavering, convince and ſtop the mouth of gain-ſayers, and to diſcover and lay open the errors, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries and abominations of that Whoor of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the poor people may be made to flee from <hi>Babylon,</hi> leſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing partakers of her ſins, they be made alſo partakers of her plagues, which are no leſs <hi>then to have their portion in that Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death.</hi> So it is our deſign in republiſhing the ſame: For what man is he that doth believe that Popery is the moſt abominable Idolatry imaginable; to wit, to worſhip the handy-work of the Baker, and wood and ſtone, &amp;c. and conſiders what ſevere threatnings he hath denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt Idolatry; namely, <hi>That they ſhal be ſhut out of that New Jeruſalem, Rev.</hi> 22.15. <hi>and ſhal drink of the wine of the wrath of GOD, and ſhal be tormented day and night before the holy Angels, and before the Lamb; and the ſmoke of their torment ſhal aſcend for evermore, and they ſhal have no reſt, Rev.</hi> 14.9. And that he <hi>is a jealous GOD, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> not only this <hi>iniquity</hi> of Idolatry upon themſelves, but likewiſe <hi>upon their children to the third and fourth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi> and is not much troubled to hear and ſee ſo many ſouls ſeduced and led aſide thereto, and doth not judge it of his concernment to lay out himſelf to the utmoſt, for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the ſnare &amp; pit that is laid for entraping and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eternally of poor ſouls? Therefore we hope as our endeavors ſhal be peace to us, ſo we hope it ſhal be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to all the lovers of truth.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106559:13"/>
            <p>That this prayerful Treatiſe of that great wreſtler with GOD, may be bleſſed, for convincing of gain-ſayers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, eſtabliſhing and confirming the LORDS people in the truth, and for ſtirring up, and awaking zeal, love and repentance in the godly, ſhal be the earneſt prayer of</p>

So that that may be moſt truely ſaid of us, which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the land of <hi>Zabulon</hi> and <hi>Nephthali, Matth.</hi> 4.16. <hi>A people that ſate in darkneſs ſaw great light: and unto them which ſate in the region of death, light is riſen up.</hi> Many Kingdoms upon whom this light is riſen, are but in part delivered from the bondage of that <hi>ſecond beaſt, Rev.</hi> 13.11. &amp; 17.4. and from that <hi>abomination of Babel,</hi> a part worſhipping the LORD, and a part worſhipping <hi>Baal,</hi> I mean the idol of the Maſs, and their idols of ſtock and ſtone. But our deliverance was full, from that bondage; for that was fulfilled in us which was promiſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of old, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14 9. <hi>That the LORD ſhould be but one, and his Name one.</hi> And in theſe Kingdoms where <hi>the LORD is but one, and his Name one;</hi> that is, where he only is worſhipped, ſome of them have embraced him, but as a Prophet, to teach them, and as a Prieſt to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for their ſins, and to interceed for them: but not as a ſoveraign King to rule them, and govern them by that form of government, which he hath preſcribed in his Word, with his own Lawes, Offices, and Officers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining yet a part of that hierarchie of <hi>Babel,</hi> with ſome of her Lawes, Offices, and Officers. But the LORD was rich in mercy towards us, in beſtowing himſelf upon us, not only as a Prophet to teach us, and as a Prieſt to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for our ſins, and to interceed for us, but alſo as a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign King, to govern us with that ſelf ſame form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which he hath commanded in his Word, and
<pb facs="tcp:106559:24"/> unto the which only he hath annexed the promiſes of his bleſſing and preſence, with his own Laws, Offices, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. So that as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.9. <hi>He was not only one in us, and his Name one:</hi> but <hi>alſo a ſoveraign King in our land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O <hi>Scotland!</hi> what Nation was like unto thee, that had the Goſpel ſo freely preached, his Sacraments ſo purely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, his cenſures and all the priviledges of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in ſuch liberty executed, as thou hadſt? For what one Nation under heaven, hath God done ſo great things, as for thee? What one Kingdom is to be found in the whole earth, where Idolatry was ſo fully rooted out, wherein all the means of his glory, and all the priviledges of his Kingdom, was ſo fully reſtored to their own integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perfection, as they were firſt inſtituted, wherein all theſe means of the Word, Sacraments, and Diſcipline, hath continued for ſo long a ſpace in ſuch peace, in ſuch purity, in ſuch liberty, without hereſie or ſchiſm, as in thee? O <hi>Scotland!</hi> So that thy day hath been like the day of <hi>Joſhua, When the Sun ſtood in Gibeon, and the Moon in Aialon, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſua</hi> 10.12. For I know not if ever Nation or Kingdom hath had ſo long a day of the Goſpel, in ſuch peace, purity, and liberty, as thou haſt had? Or if ever Nation after us, ſhal have ſo long a day, after ſuch a manner again. And it ſeems to me, that as the LORD confirmed <hi>Ezechiah</hi> of his promiſe, by cauſing, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 20. the Sun to return back again miraculouſly, by the degrees whereby it went down: So the LORD hath confirmed his ſuperabundant love towards us, in cauſing the light of the Goſpel to return again (as it were) oft times, and that moſt wonderfully and miraculouſly, by the degrees whereby our iniquities in the righteous judgement of God, did haſten it to go down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. Yea, the bleſſing of Abraham hath come upon us. <hi>For he hath bleſſed them that bleſſed us, and hath curſed them who
<pb facs="tcp:106559:24"/> hath curſed us, he hath ſtriven againſt them who hath ſtriven againſt us, and hath made our oppreſſors to eat their own fleſh, and to drink their own blood: no inſtrument formed againſt thee,</hi> (O Church of Scotland!) <hi>hath ever proſpered: and the tongue that hath riſen againſt thee, the LORD hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, that all fleſh might know that GOD was thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior, and the ſtrong GOD of Jacob thy avenger.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if ever people might have been called <hi>Jephzibas, Eſai</hi> 62.6. that is, the LORDS delight, or their land, <hi>Beula;</hi> that is, married unto him; the Church and Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> might have been ſo called. For the LORD had delight in us, and our land hath a husband, even the LORD our Redeemer, he was <hi>an ornament unto us, Eſa.</hi> 60 19. he ſet <hi>his beautie on us; Ezech.</hi> 16.14. <hi>he crowned us with glory, and a Diadem by the hand of our GOD, was ſet upon our heads, Eſai</hi> 6.2. And true is that of us, which our Savior ſpake to his diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.24. <hi>Many Kings and Prophets hath deſired to ſee the things that we have ſeen, and hear the things that we have heard, and have not ſeen them nor heard them.</hi> So who are ſo ladened with mercy and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as we have been? for we have been made <hi>the head and not the tail, Deut.</hi> 28.13. as the LORD promiſed. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if ever people ſhould have been <hi>Joſhurim, Deut.</hi> 32.15. that is upright and ſtraight in the eyes of the LORD, we ſhould have been ſo. No, who ſhould have been ſo holy as we? Who ſo <hi>ſtrong in CHRIST, and rooted and grounded in him,</hi> as we? <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.7. Who ſo rich in all grace, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all good works, as we? For who had ſo many and ſo glorious means, to have made us to have abounded in all grace, as we had? <hi>What could the LORD have done more to us, then he hath done, Iſai.</hi> 5.4. For we wanted no mean that ever the LORD commanded in his Word, either to have bred grace in us, or to have preſerved it and increaſed it? <hi>But they to whom much is given, much
<pb facs="tcp:106559:25"/> ſhal be required at their hands again.</hi> For as the LORD made us a ſpectacle of his mercy, wherein he did demonſtrat the riches of his free grace in CHRIST JESUS, unto all the Kingdoms of the earth, and above them all: So it had been our part proportionably, to have met him with thankfulneſs again: and to have been examples of all grace, godlineſs, righteouſneſs, and of all good works, unto all others, and above all others. But, alace! <hi>ſinful Nation, laden with iniquities, Eſai</hi> 1.4. who is ſo ſinful as thou art? What Nation ſo polluted with all abomination and wickedneſs, as thou art? Thy iniquities are mo then the ſand of the ſea, they are grown up ſo high, that the top of them reach up to the very heavens, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 9.7. and the cry of them is like, yea beyond the cry of <hi>Sodom:</hi> there is ſuch a burden of iniquity upon this Land, that (conſidering all circumſtances both of the means, and of the time and ſpace the LORD hath given us to repent) I know not if ever Nation, was ſo great in the eyes of the LORD as this Land is. For may not that which the Prophet ſpake of <hi>Juda. Ezechiel</hi> 22. be moſt juſtly ſaid of thee? <hi>O Scotland!</hi> For art thou not repleniſhed with blood, from corner to corner, ſo that blood touches blood? Are not thy Nobles in thee, every one ready to ſhed blood? In thee the father and the mother are deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: in the midſt of thee, the widow and the fatherleſs are oppreſſed: In thee the very abominations of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils are committed. The diſcovering of the Fathers ſhame, and adultery with thy neighbors wife: thou art ſo laden with adulteries, inceſts, and whoredooms, that the Land groans under thee: thou haſt prophaned his Sabaths, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed his Law, contemned his Goſpel, withholden from him the fruits of his Kingdom, and haſt trodden under foot the blood of CHRIST, and haſt grieved that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace. So that when I think of the number and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb facs="tcp:106559:25"/> of our ſins, I cannot but wonder that the LORD ſhould not <hi>have withdrawn his Kingdom long ſince from us, and have given it unto others, that would have brought forth the fruits thereof, Matth.</hi> 21.41. Yea, I wonder, that he hath not cauſed the <hi>Land to vomit us out,</hi> for the abominations and ſins wherewith we have defiled it, in ſo great a light. And ſurely, when I think of the ſeverity of the Juſtice of GOD, in puniſhing other Nations and Kingdoms, for the contempt of his Goſpel, and the withholding of the fruits of his Kingdom from him, my ſoul trembles. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did the LORD <hi>reject the natural branches,</hi> that cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen generation, <hi>of whom the Fathers was, and of whom CHRIST was according to the fleſh, Rom.</hi> 11.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.42.43. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.41. And wherefore did the <hi>LORD remove his Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, Rev.</hi> 2.5. from a great many of the Churches, both of the Eaſt, and of the Weſt, which were planted by the Apoſtles, and were once lanterns of light, and hath given them over to ſtrong deluſions to believe lies, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10.12. the one to the impiety of Mahomet, and the ſavage Tyrant of the Church: the other to the <hi>bondage of that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond beaſt, and fearful darkneſs of that bottomleſs pit. Rev.</hi> 13.11. &amp; 9.1. But becauſe they received not the love of the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith? 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. Now if GOD ſpared not them, but gave them over to a moſt fearful bondage, both of ſoul and body, both ſpiritual and corporal, temporal and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; how ſhould we not fear, as great, or rather greater
<pb facs="tcp:106559:26"/> judgements, ſeeing we had all theſe as examples before us, to have fore-warned us, and to have made us to fear? For we are not to think, as our Savior ſaith to the <hi>Galileans, that they were greater ſinners then we; but unleſs we all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, we ſhal likewiſe periſh, Luke</hi> 13.3. And as though all our former ſins were too light to pull down and to haſten the LORDS fearful departing from us, this <hi>darkneſs of the bottomleſs pit, Rev.</hi> 9.1. which is ſpreading it ſelf again in this corner of the Countrey, and this <hi>abomination of deſolation,</hi> the idol of the Maſs, which is ſet up in the privat families of this Countrey, is <hi>added unto all the reſt, and above all the rest.</hi> So that it is to be feared, unleſs it be prevented by a moſt ſpeedy and earneſt repentance of all ſorts in this Land, that as <hi>we have been lifted up to heaven through his Goſpel, Matth.</hi> 11.23. ſo ſhal we be thrown down in the bottomleſs gulf of the LORDS fearful wrath and vengeance: and as we have been made a ſpectacle of his mercy unto all Nations, and above all other; ſo we ſhal be made a moſt fearful ſpectacle of his wrath unto all other Nations, and above all other. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the LORD would <hi>powr upon us that Spirit of grace and deprecation, that even from the houſe of David to the houſe of Levi: Zech.</hi> 12.10.11.12. that is, from the Kings houſe, to the Miniſterie, and from them to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, from man to wife, that we might all look up to him, whom we have pierced through with our iniquities: and mourn upon him, as for our firſt or only begotten ſon: and that we might mourn publickly &amp; privatly, together and a part, every Congregation by themſelves, and every family by themſelves, and every perſon by himſelf. Oh, that we had hearts to repent; at the leaſt, in the evening of this our day, before the Sun went down altogether upon us: and then there is no queſtion the LORD would not <hi>remove his Candleſtick from us, Rev.</hi> 2.5. <hi>nor make his glory to depart,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106559:26"/> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.22. but would continue his covenant with us and our poſterity, and would cover all our enemies faces with ſhame, as with a garment: yea, he would ſcatter that darkneſs that is beginning to overſpread this Land again, <hi>and Dagon ſhould fall before the ark of the Lord:</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.3.4 and his laſt fall ſhould be worſe then his firſt. Let me therefore be bold with you, to beſeech you, yea to charge you in the bowels of JESUS CHRIST, by the price of his blood, and by his glorious appearing to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ye would have it comfortable to you, and as ye would have his glory to remain with us and our poſteritie: yea, as ye would not be arraigned guilty, in that great day of the LORDS baniſhment, and removing of his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence out of this Land. (For if we repent not, the LORD, as he hath begun to depart from a great part of this Countrey, ſo ſhal he moſt aſſuredly depart from the reſt of this Land.) I ſay, Let me beſeech you, that every one of you would try and ſearch your ſins, by the light of his Spirit in his Word, both the ſins of our perſons and callings, that we would humble our hearts for them, and powr them out as water in his boſom, mourning for them, and for the ſins of the Land: <hi>Ezec.</hi> 9.4. and that we would turn our feet to walk in all his precepts and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. And let us who are the Watch-men over the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> begin firſt, <hi>Ezec.</hi> 3.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 33. For the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of GOD will begin at his own houſe, and at the Sanctuary. For if we that are the lights of our people be darkneſs, how great muſt their darkneſs be?

And if that we that is the ſtomack and the heart; as it were, become ſenſeleſs, and dead; is it any wonder ſuppoſe all the reſt of the members be dead and ſenſeleſs? Let us therefore firſt convert our
<pb facs="tcp:106559:27"/> ſelves, and then let us with tears and mourning cry aloud to our Congregations, and ſpare not. Let us lift up our voices as a Trumpet, that the deafeſt and deadeſt may hear. Let us ſhow them their ſins and defections, that at the leaſt, they periſh not for want of warning, and ſo their blood be craved at our hands, <hi>Ezec.</hi> 3.3.4.5. Let us be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, to preach the Word, improve, rebuke, exhort, with all doctrine and long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as we are moſt gravely charged by the Spirit of GOD. Let us admoniſh every man, and inſtruct every man publickly, and privatly: that we may do our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor at the leaſt, to preſent every man perfect, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28. as a pure Virgin to JESUS CHRIST. And if they will not hear, let us ſay to the earth, <hi>Earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD: let us riſe up and contend with the mountains, and let us make the hills to hear our voice, and take them as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt them.</hi> And then ſhal we have this comfort in the dayes of our afflictions, <hi>that we have not kept back the word of the holy One.

Shine before your tenants, ſervants, and houſe-holders, <hi>as lanterns of light;</hi> for ſuch Maſter, ſuch ſervant. Be examples to them of godlineſs, ſobriety, and righteouſneſs. Cleanſe your hearts and hands from blood,
<pb facs="tcp:106559:27"/> oppreſſions, whoredoms, adulteries. <hi>Be an eye to the blind, and a foot to the lame, and a ſtaff of comfort to the oppreſſed. Deal your bread to the hungry, and hide not your eyes from your own fleſh, Eſai.</hi> 58.7. <hi>maintain the godly, and be a terror to the wicked, Rom.</hi> 13.3.4. That your faces may chaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way iniquity, and fin may hide its ſelf from your preſence. Take vengeance on all evil doers, and ſpare not where the LORD bids ſtrike. And becauſe a great many of you, through your moſt cruel and barbarous covetouſneſs &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege (the like whereof I think hath not been heard of, no not among the Turks, and barbarous <hi>Americans,</hi> that they ſpoil their GOD, and let their worſhip decay for want of maintenance, as ye do in <hi>Scotland:</hi>) are the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the everlaſting damnation of a great part of the poor people, for want of the preaching of the Word of ſalvation unto them. For <hi>their blood are found under your wings: Jerem.</hi> 2.34. and their blood cry more ſtrongly from the low hells, to the high heavens againſt you, for wrath and vengeance, then ever <hi>Abels</hi> blood did againſt his brother <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.10.</p>
            <p>Now therefore at the laſt, repent you of it. Purge your hands of it; and at the leaſt vouchſafe ſo much upon every Church; as may ſuſtain a Paſtor to break the bread of life unto them: and think the damnation of ſo many millions of ſouls of your poor brethren, who might have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for ought that ye know, if they had had the Goſpel of ſalvation preached unto them: too great guiltineſs, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ye had not blood upon blood. Otherwiſe, if ye will not, I call heaven and earth to witneſs againſt you, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.19. that the indignation of the LORD ſhal root you and your poſterity out of the land of the living: and their blood that periſh for want of teaching, ſhal be laid to your charge, and ye ſhal be arraigned as murderers of their ſouls, in that great day. And not only that curſe ſhal
<pb facs="tcp:106559:28"/> fall upon you, which was commanded to be pronounced upon Mount <hi>Hebal, Deut.</hi> 27.23.18. for cauſing the blind to go out of the way, whereunto all the people ſhould ſay, <hi>Amen:</hi> But alſo, that moſt fearful and irrevocable ſentence ſhal be pronounced, and executed upon you in that great day, (by the Judge of the whole earth,) <hi>Depart from me ye curſed, in that everlasting fire of hell, to be damned with the Devil and his Angels for evermore. Matth.</hi> 25.41. Lay it therefore to your hearts, and flatter not your ſelves in a carnal and vain preſumption. Be not cruel to your own ſouls, and to the ſouls of the poor people any more: otherwiſe ye ſhal moſt aſſuredly drink of the wine of the wrath of God, and be caſten in the great wine-fat of his wrath, where there ye ſhal be tormented day and night. Let every one of us therefore in the conſcience of ſo great and ſingular mercies, which the LORD hath vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed upon us, in ſuch a plentiful meaſure, <hi>Harden not our hearts while it is called to day: but let us rent them, and turn them unto the LORD our GOD; Heb.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Joel.</hi> 2.13. and let us not delay it, while he calls upon us by his word, and ſpreads out his arms unto us. Otherwiſe, if we will not, but deſpiſe the day of our ſalvation. then I proteſt unto you in the Name of the great GOD, that he will hear the cry of our ſins, and will abhor us great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he did <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he ſhal <hi>forſake his glorious Tents and Tabernacles</hi> in this land: and firſt <hi>give over his ſtrength to captivitie, and his glory to the hands of our enemies, Pſal.</hi> 78.49.60.61. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then accounting no more of us, then of the myre in the ſtreet, he ſhal deliver us over, both old and young. Paſtor and people, to the ſword of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. For this, I dare ſay, if he take his Kingdom from us, he ſhal not let <hi>Scotland</hi> be a free Kingdom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.43. as it hath been before. For true is he who hath ſaid it, <hi>The Nation and Kingdom that will not ſerve thee, ſhal periſh,
<pb facs="tcp:106559:28"/> and theſe Nations ſhal be utterly deſtroyed, Eſai.</hi> 60.12. And if he ſpare not his own ſtrength and glory, I mean his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goſpel, but deliver it over into captivity; into the hands of his enemies, he ſhal have no compaſſion of us, but ſhal ſurrender us over to the edge of the ſword to be conſumed thereby: and as the LORD hath been more abundant in his mercy towards us, then towards any others: ſo ſhal his wrath be accordingly. For if other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms or Nations, yea if <hi>Tyrus</hi> or <hi>Sidon, Sodom</hi> or <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rha: Matth.</hi> 11.21.22. yea if the Turks or barbarous <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans</hi> had heard the things that we have heard, they would have repented long ſince in ſackcloth and aſhes: and therefore our condemnation ſhal be heavier, then any condemnation under heaven. Now therefore <hi>if there be any conſolation in CHRIST, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the Spirit, Philip.</hi> 2.1. <hi>if any love to his glorie,</hi> to his blood, to his Goſpel, and if there be any compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and mercy in your hearts, to this poor and ſinful land, and his poor Church and Kingdom therein: repent you of your ſins, reconcile you to GOD, take hold of his blood, waſh you and cleanſe you in it, until ye be white and bright in his eyes. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14.

            <p>Now, oh! that the LORD would give us theſe hearts, and ſo purge us, that we might be thus fruitful to the praiſe of his glory: then aſſuredly would he repent him of all the evil that he hath thought againſt us; then ſhould he have delight in us, &amp; in our poſterity: and then theſe <hi>Canaanites,</hi> (I mean the relicks of that curſed generation of <hi>Babel,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) which is yet left unrooted out of this land, to try us and tempt us, if we will ſerve the LORD our GOD, and to be pricks and thorns in our ſide, ſhould not bring us in bondage again, but ſhould be made tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries to JESUS CHRIST: yea, our latter eſtat, ſhould be more glorious then the former. Now let us find this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor in thy eyes, O LORD, our Redeemer: and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thy great Name among us, by converting our hearts, at the leaſt the hearts of all thy children, in mercy rather, then by confounding and conſuming of us in thy wrath and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. For wherefore ſhould thy enemies ſay, Take up their GOD and their Goſpel? Wherefore ſhould they, O LORD our GOD, blaſpheme thy holy Name, when they ſhal ſee thee angrie with thy own inheritance, and redeemed ones? Oh! turn us unto thee, and put us not away from thy face: and let not thoſe that are thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, triumph over us. Purchaſe thy ſelf an everlaſting Name, through our converſion and repentance, that the enemie and the avenger may be ſtill: and our hearts may be inlarged, and our mouthes may be opened, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the everlaſting mercies, and to ſhout forth thy prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Turn you unto him, you that are his children, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his Tents. You that love the beautie of <hi>Sion,</hi> and

Cauſe heaven and earth to be filled with groans and ſighs of his own Spirit in you: and take a claught of that Prince of life, ere he remove altogether: and before he have ſtollen himſelf far away, that he cannot be found again. And wreſtle with him, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, and let him not depart out of your hearts: entreat him, yea enforce him, as it were, by your tears and ſorrowful cryes, not to leave his own Tents and Tabernacles in this Land: not to give over his glorious Goſpel, which is his <hi>ſtrength and glorie,</hi> into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, in the hands of their enemies. Remember that he cannot abide the interceſſion of his own Spirit in his own. He cannot hide his eyes from his own fleſh and blood: he can deny nothing to his own beloved Son, that makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for his Saints. Let us therefore ſtep up to that Throne of grace with all confidence: and aſſuredly, as he is true who hath promiſed, we ſhal find grace and mercy in the time of this our need: both comfort to our own hearts, and it may be peace in our dayes, that our eyes ſhal not ſee the evils that are to come: and at that bright appearing of our LORD of life, all tears ſhal be wiped away from our eyes. We ſhal be clothed with thoſe long white robes, and ſhal be fed with the fatneſs of his houſe, and ſhal drink of the rivers of his pleaſures, which is at his right hand for evermore. For <hi>Sions</hi> ſake in this Land, Chriſtian Reader, have I thus written unto thee: and for <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> cauſe, have I not kept ſilence at this time, that her glory and wonted brightneſs may be renewed, &amp; that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> which was the beauty of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the praiſe of the whole earth, for her liberty, purity, and diſcipline, might be eſtabliſhed in the ſame; and her ſalvation and righteouſneſs, might break forth as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning lamp, to all the Nations of the earth: and that
<pb facs="tcp:106559:30"/> other Churches in other Kingdoms, which deſired to ſee our beauty and ſpiritual glory and accounted them bleſſed which might have had the occaſion to have dwelt in our Tents, to have ſeen and enjoyed the ſame: yea who would have been content to have bought it with the price of their blood to their poſteritie: that they, I ſay, may ſee the continuance thereof and may rejoice. Turn thou, O LORD our GOD, our hearts unto thee, that thy glorious preſence may be continued with us for ever, for JESUS CHRIST his ſake, our LORD and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, to whom be all praiſe and glory, for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I come to this matter in hand: the occaſion of it was this. There was one who was ſometimes an hearer of the word with me, who ſhew me that he had been in conference with a Papiſt, and he had brought him thus far, that if he would ſhow him of any that profeſſed our Religion before <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> he would renounce his Papiſtry, and therefore deſired me to ſet them down in writ. The which I did: and ſet it down in this form, as thou ſeeſt it here. So this being carried to <hi>M. Gilbert Brown,</hi> he writs an anſwer to it, and ſent it to me. Unto the which I have made this reply. Thou haſt them all three here: firſt, that which I did write, then his anſwer to it, and then my reply to his anſwer.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is true Chriſtian Reader, that there was many things that did hinder me &amp; withdraw me from this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either to make any anſwer to it at all, or yet to let it go forth to the light. As firſt, that ſo many things have been written already by the lights &amp; lanterns of this age againſt that ruinous <hi>Babel,</hi> that all further co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>victions ſeemed to be ſuperfluous. Next, the conſcience of my own tenuitie and weakneſs, together with a continual burden of a fourfold teaching every week in my ordinary charge, beſide others
<pb facs="tcp:106559:30"/> both privat and publick duties, which not only my own people, but alſo this deſolat Countrey craved, whereby I was let to afford that time and ſtudie unto it, as the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of ſuch a matter required. And laſt of all, the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration both of the perſon and work of the adverſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that neither the one nor the other would be accounted worthy of any anſwer at all himſelf being both rejected and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, according to the expreſs commandment of the holy Ghoſt, as <hi>an Heretick, being perverted and damned in his own conſcience, and delivered over unto Satan, that he might learn, if it were poſſible, not to blaſpheme the everlaſting truth of GOD any more, Tit.</hi> 3.10.11.12. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. And alſo denounced his rebel, for his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable attempts, both againſt this Church and Kingdom: his work alſo being ſo fooliſh in its ſelf, as both I heard his Majeſtie affirm, that he was a fooliſh reaſoner in it: and alſo I hope, the indifferent Reader ſhal ſee the ſame: his reaſons &amp; arguments being alſo ſo oft anſwered unto by the learned of our ſide, ſo that it ſeemed but <hi>actum agere,</hi> to make any further anſwer thereunto: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all theſe impediments, theſe motions and reaſons prevailed with me at the laſt, both to anſwer it, and alſo to let it go forth to the open view and ſight of all men: to wit, the conſcience of that duty which I ow unto the truth of GOD, being ſo highly blaſphemed and evil ſpoken of: the unfained love of the ſalvation of my Countrey-men, who for the moſt part, are blinded with the ſmoke of the darkneſs of that bottomleſs pit: the railing and thraſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical bragging of the adverſary, both by word and writ, that it would never be anſwered: and that the Miniſtery would never ſuffer an anſwer to come to light, becauſe they knew the anſwer to be unworthy, and none other was able to anſwer to it: the moſt earneſt preſſing of a great many of my brethren, who knew the lamentable
<pb facs="tcp:106559:31"/> eſtat of this blind Countrey: the conſtant deſire of all men in this Countrey to ſee the ſame: together with his Majeſties moſt gracious acceptation of my endeavor, and moſt favorable judgement of this my labor, and moſt humane counſel to publiſh the ſame, which did not a little incourage me: and laſt of all, the expreſs commandment of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Anſwer a fool according to his follie, leſt he ſeem wiſe in his own eyes:</hi> the which if it have place in any thing, it muſt have place here, where not only this ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming wiſe in his own eyes, would undoubtedly follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſilence, but alſo a ſeeming wiſe in the eyes of all this part of the Countrey almoſt: both to the prejudice of the everlaſting truth of GOD, and alſo to the ſtumbling of the weak, the further obduring of the obſtinat, and the wounding of the hearts of the godly therein. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin. lib. de Trinitate, cap.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; lib. cont. Mend. cap.</hi> 6. hath a notable ſentence to this purpoſe. <hi>It is to be wiſhed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>where hereſie flowriſhes, that all theſe who have any gift of writing, that they all write, ſuppoſe they ſhould write not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the ſelf-ſame matters or questions, but alſo the ſelf-ſame things or arguments, ſuppoſe perchance in other words. For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it is expedient that Hereticks underſtand that there are not only one or two, but many in the camps of the Catholicks, who dare with open face meet them.</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>There is another commodity that comes by the writing of many: to wit, that by this means, the Catholicks books themſelves are more ſhortly and eaſily brought unto the hands of all men, ſo that while as ſome fall upon one, and ſome fall upon others, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they are all instructed to uſe the ſame weapons in their common dangers.</hi> The which how fitly it agrees unto this purpoſe of mine, I leave it to the judgement of all men, who know the eſtat of this blinded Countrey, wherein that darkneſs of the Antichriſtian Kingdom is ſo far ſpred, the confident brags of the adverſary are ſo univerſally
<pb facs="tcp:106559:31"/> credited, the people ſcattered as ſheep without ſhepherd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Not unlike the miſerable eſtate wherein the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were brought unto, through the tyranny of the <hi>Philistims, wanting both ſword and ſpear in the time of their warfare, having no ſmiths in their whole land, whereby they were compelled to go to their enemies to ſharpen their cowter and ſock, and other instruments,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.19.20 22. Now as for the work it ſelf, I ſay nothing of it, but only recommend it to the bleſſing of GOD in all your hearts and conſciences.

                  <p>As to your anſwer: Firſt, ye deny it and deteſt it as a blaſphemy. Next, ye go about to clear your ſelves from the ſuſpicion of it. Thirdly, ye challenge us and our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with the crimes of novelty and hereſie: And ſo ye conclud, ye could do no leſs nor impugn it.</p>
                  <p>As to your denying of the defacing of the truth of God, ſo doth <hi>the whoriſh woman,</hi> Prov. 30.20. <hi>after ſhe hath eaten, ſhe wipes her mouth, and ſaith, ſhe hath not ſinned:</hi> which is true as well in ſpiritual as in bodily fornication: So not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your Church hath buried the truth of God in the graves of darkneſs, and did overcover it with their traditions and gloſſes theſe many years by gone, yet you wipe your mouthes, and ſay, you have not ſinned. But look to it in time; for ignorance, and zeal without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, will not excuſe you in the day of the Lord. That you deteſt it as a blaſphemy, ſo did the <hi>high Prieſt rent his clothes, and ſaid Chriſt blaſphemed, Matth.</hi> 26.65. when he ſpake but the truth. As for your golden ſtyles which you take to your ſelves of <hi>Catholicks, defenders of the truth, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors to the Paſtors of the true Church, and impugners of all falſe doctrine.</hi> Your doctrine indeed could not deceive ſo many, if it were not covered with theſe ſtyles: your poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and abomination would not be drunken ſo univerſally, if it were not in ſuch a golden cup as this, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.4. So theſe are the hyſſop wherewith ye would waſh you from this iniquity, and cleanſe you from this ſin. But may not <hi>falſe Prophets come in ſheeps clothing? Matth.</hi> 7.15.

                  <hi>SECTION II.</hi> Whither the Church of Rome is the Catholick Church?</head>
               <p>ANd becauſe, Chriſtian Reader, by this ſtyle of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi> which they aſcrive only to their Church, they cauſe the ſimple to err, and leads many blind-fold to damnation; therefore I will take this viſard from them. Ye are not the Catholick Church, as ye ſtyle your ſelf, and thus I prove it. Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, who wrote a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm according to the decree of the Council of <hi>Trent, (Catechiſm. Conc. Trident. in expoſitione Symb.)</hi> He there ſaith, <hi>That the Church which is called the body of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is the head, is called Catholick, becauſe it is ſpread in the light of one faith from the Eaſt to the West, receiving men of all ſorts, containing all the faithful which have been from Adam, even until this day, or ſhal be hereafter to the end of the world profeſſing the true faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now I reaſon thus: The Catholick Church compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all the faithful from <hi>Adam</hi> till now, and that ſhal be hereafter to the end of the world, or elſe Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> and the Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> errs. But the <hi>Roman</hi> Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106559:35"/> not all the faithful from <hi>Adam</hi> till now, and that ſhal be hereafter: Therefore the Roman Church is not the Catholick Church. Chooſe you now which of theſe ye will deny. The propoſition, I ſuppoſe, ye will not: for then ye ſhould bring two inconveniencies; the one upon Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> and the Fathers of <hi>Trent,</hi> that they have erred in defining the Catholick Church, and ſo the Church and the Pope may err. The other is upon your ſelf, who ſaid that your Church hath not erred. And ſo ye loſe your ſtyl of a defender of the Catholick faith: for this is a chief point of their faith, that the Church cannot err. I hope therefore that theſe are Labyrinths which ye will not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly caſt your ſelf into, and ſo you muſt hold faſt the propoſition. All the queſtion is then of the aſſumption, Whither the <hi>Roman</hi> Church comprehends all the faithful from <hi>Adam</hi> till now, and which ſhal be to the end of the world, or not? Firſt, I ſay, a particular Church compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends not all the faithful from <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp;c. But the Roman Church is a particular Church, or elſe the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Baſile,</hi> and <hi>Verratus</hi> a Papiſt errs; for they call the Roman Church a particular Church. <hi>We grant,</hi> ſay they, (<hi>Baſil. Concil. Epiſt. Synod.</hi> 3 <hi>Verratus diſputationum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Lutheranos, Tom.</hi> 6. <hi>de authoritate &amp; poteſt. univerſ. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. cap.</hi> 1.) <hi>that the Roman Church is a principal Church among others; but while you commend a part, forget not the whole.</hi> And they ſay, <hi>The Univerſal Church comprehends the Roman Church.</hi> Chooſe you then whither will you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Baſile,</hi> and a Papiſt <hi>Verratus,</hi> and be ſo abſurd as to call the arm of the body the whole body; an arm of the Ocean ſea, the whole Ocean ſea; or to go from your tittle, that the Roman Church is not the Catholick Church?</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Catholick Church comprehends them that were before Chriſt: but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106559:36"/> not them; for there was a Church ere ever there was a Church at <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Roman Church compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends none but them that acknowledges the Pope to be the head of the Church. But thoſe that were before Chriſt never did that: Therefore the Roman Church is not the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Catholick Church is inviſible: for at the leaſt, neither are they that are glorified, neither are they that are to be born, viſible. But ye will not have the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, but alwayes viſible: Therefore the Roman Church is not the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if the Roman Church be the Catholick Church, then either it ſhal follow, that the Pope is the head of the Catholick Church, or elſe that the Roman Church wants a viſible head. Chooſe you whither of theſe ye will; for the one ye muſt, if ye will have the Roman Church to be the Catholick Church. But to ſay that the Pope is the head of the Catholick Church, I ſuppoſe ye dare not be ſo blaſphemous: for the glorified Saints, and <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, are of the Catholick Church; or elſe (as I ſaid before) Pope <hi>Pius</hi> and the Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> errs. And ſo then if ye will make him head of the Catholick Church, ye muſt make him head of the glorified Saints, and of <hi>Peter</hi> alſo. So then chooſe you whither will ye leave the ſtyle of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, which ye claim as proper to your Church; or will ye have the Pope the head of the triumphant Church in heaven? Or laſt of all will ye have your Roman Church to want a viſible head? One of theſe ye muſt chooſe. So to end this point, this ſtyle of Catholick, it is like the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering of the people by <hi>David:</hi> for as it brought him in a wonderful ſtrait, when he ſaw it behoved him to chooſe, either ſeven years famine, or four moneths flying before his enemies, or three days peſtilence, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. So this tittle of yours, if you will abide by it, brings you in a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106559:36"/> wonderful ſtrait: for ye have not the choiſe of one of three evils; but theſe three things muſt ye either chooſe, or elſe let this ſtyle of Catholick go; one of you fighting againſt another, the Church inviſible, and the Pope not to be the head of the Church. Of the which, the leaſt of theſe is more able to overthrow your Kingdom, then they all were able to have overthrown the Kingdom of <hi>David;</hi> for they are the main pillars of your Kingdom, your unity, your viſibility, your Popes ſupremacy; all which you muſt either loſe, or elſe let your ſtyle of Catholick go from your Church. But how will ye wreſtle your ſelf out of this? For if ye will believe the Fathers of <hi>Trent,</hi> and Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> in defining the Catholick Church, ye cannot eſchew theſe inconveniencies. And if you will not believe them, that they ſpake truly in that point, ye muſt accuſe them of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. And ſo the Church hath erred, the Pope hath erred, and your ſelf hath erred, that ſaid your Church hath the truth in all things. And ſurely as <hi>Cajaphas</hi> being high Prieſt that year, ſpake the truth, when he ſaid that one muſt die for the people, <hi>John</hi> 11.50. and not the whole Nation pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, ſuppoſe in an evil ſenſe. So have the Fathers of <hi>Trent,</hi> and Pope <hi>Pius</hi> here ſpoken truly, both according to the Scriptures; for the Church is called the <hi>aſſembly of the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, whoſe names are written in heaven, Heb.</hi> 12.23. And that <hi>new Jeruſalem which is from above, which is the mother of us all, Gal.</hi> 4.26. And alſo according to the Fathers, <hi>Clem. Alex. Strom. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp; Bernard in Cant. c.</hi> 78. <hi>&amp; Auguſt. de catechiſ. rud. cap.</hi> 20. <hi>&amp; Gregor. moral. in Job. lib.</hi> 28. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. who affirmeth that <hi>the Church is the company of the predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, and all the elect are within the compaſs of it, &amp; are citizens of it.</hi> So as Chriſt ſaid to the Jews, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.27. <hi>If I caſt out devils by the prince of devils, by whom then caſteth your children them out?</hi> So if we ſpeak now by an erroneous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that ſayes the Catholick Church comprehends all the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106559:37"/> elect, that was, is, and ſhal be, and the Church of Rome cannot be the Catholick Church. By what ſpirit hath your Council and Pope and theſe Fathers ſpoken the ſame? So not your children, but your Fathers ſhal be your Judges.</p>
               <p>Ye did mark ſome contradiction, as ye thought, between me and ſome others, unto the which I will anſwer in the own time. Let me therefore mark this one now, and mark it, Reader. Ye have heard now how that all theſe with one voice have ſaid, that the Catholick Church compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all the elect, that was, is, and ſhal be. Is it any here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie then to hold this point? I think you will not, nor dare not ſay it. What will you ſay then to your general Council of <hi>Conſtance, Seſſ</hi> 15. <hi>art.</hi> 1. 6. who condemned <hi>John Hus</hi> for the ſame doctrine, the firſt and ſixth article, for ſaying that there is <hi>an Univerſal Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the company of the predeſtinat, and as it is taken in this ſenſe, it is an article of our faith?</hi> For theſe, among the reſt, was this pure innocent condemned and burnt as an heretick, &amp; his doctrine as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie: which of theſe will ye ſay now have erred, whither the general Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> or the Fathers of <hi>Trent,</hi> Pope <hi>Pius, Gregorie, Auguſtine, Clement,</hi> and <hi>Bernard?</hi> For ſurely if the latter erred not, then not only did the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> err, but alſo have brought upon themſelves innocent blood, in condemning the innocent, and the truth in him. And if the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> erred not, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning theſe articles of <hi>John Hus,</hi> then have they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the doctrine of the Fathers of <hi>Trent,</hi> Pope <hi>Pius, Gregorie, Auguſtine, &amp;c.</hi> and their perſons, in the perſon of <hi>John Hus.</hi> Chooſe which of them ye will. I ſpeak the truth to thee in Chriſt (Reader) be not deceived. But open thy eyes and behold the veritie it ſelf condemned by a general Council, and the profeſſor of it burnt for an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick: but his blood and <hi>the blood of the reſt of the martyrs of God, is found in this whore of Babel, and therefore one day ſhe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106559:37"/> ſhal be recompenſed for all her iniquity, Rev.</hi> 17.6. <hi>and</hi> 18.24. Go out of her therefore, and ſave thy ſoul, that thou be not tormented in the lake that burns with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone with her for evermore, <hi>Rev</hi> 18.45. Otherwiſe I call heaven and earth to witneſs againſt thee, that thou ſhalt die in her ſin, and the <hi>ſmoke of thy torment ſhal aſcend for evermore, Rev.</hi> 14.1.</p>
               <p>What now will you ſay to theſe things, that your Church is not the Catholick Church, but a part of it only; and is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Catholick, becauſe of the Catholick doctrine that ſhe profeſſes? But if this be true, wherefore then did your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council condemn it in <hi>John Hus,</hi> and burn him for that doctrine, which both your ſelf muſt confeſs to be true, and is agreeable to Scripture, Fathers, and your own Popes?</p>
               <p>Next, I ſay, ſuppoſe when ye are brought to this ſtrait, ye muſt ſay ſo: yet for all this, not only call ye your Church Catholick, becauſe of the ſoundneſs of doctrine which ye ſuppoſe ſhe profeſſes, but alſo and ſpeciallie to make the ſimple believe, that there is no ſalvation out of her: As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the Epiſtle of Cardinal <hi>Cuſanus,</hi> writing to the <hi>Bohemians, Cochlaeus hiſtor. Huſſitar. lib.</hi> 21. Therefore ye call it the only true Church, and the Catholick Church: for out of the particular Church there is ſalvation, but out of the Catholick Church there is no ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, I ſay, as the Epiſtles of <hi>Peter, John, James,</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi> are intituled <hi>Catholick,</hi> not becauſe of the ſoundneſs of their doctrine, which is common to the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, and all the reſt of the Scripture, which in that reſpect may alſo be called Catholick, but becauſe they are written generallie to all: So the Church is called Catholick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, not becauſe of the ſoundneſs of doctrine, for that is common to all the particular Churches that have the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Religion, but becauſe it comprehends all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, and all the elect. And alſo to put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106559:38"/> between the Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> which did comprehend but one certain people, and the Chriſtian Church ſince the coming of Chriſt, which is not bound to any certain place or nation, or people, but indifferently receives all, both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentil</hi> that believes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it called Catholick: and therefore in our Belief we ſay not, I believe the Catholick doctrine, but the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church. So by this ſhe is properlie diſtinguiſhed from particular Churches, as the mother from the daughters, and the whole body from the particular members. So then if you would ſpeak properlie of your Church, and not make your ſtyles ſnares to catch the ſouls of the ſimple, call her but a particular Church, and a member of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, but yet dead and rotten, as ſhal be ſhown afterward, by the grace of God. Otherwiſe, if you will but call her the Catholick Church, you firſt rob the mother, for ſhe is properly Catholick, and alſo injures the reſt of the daughters: For in reſpect of the ſoundneſs of faith, they may alſo challenge the ſame to them.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, ye deceive the ſouls of the ſimple thereby, by making them believe there is not one other Church but yours. And laſt of all, you are ſacrilegious, in decking an adultereſs with the ſtyles of the ſpouſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>As to the third point, wherein ye calumniate the truth of God which we profeſs, in calling it a new Evangel, and old renewed, and new invented hereſies of our own. Theſe are indeed heavie words wherewith ye blaſpheme the word of the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.6. <hi>and</hi> 19.9. and ſpeak evil of it to the people of this Countrey. And therefore as the Apoſtle ſaith of them that blaſphemed his doctrine, <hi>Your damnation is juſt, Rom.</hi> 3.8. For a wo by Gods own mouth is pronounced againſt them that <hi>call good evil, and evil good, truth falſhood, and falſhood truth, and darkneſs light, and light darkneſs, Iſai.</hi> 5.20. But as the Archangel when he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106559:38"/> ſtrave with Satan about the body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> did not blame him with curſed ſpeaking, but ſaid, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee, Jude</hi> 9. ſo we will not blame you with curſed ſpeaking, but the Lord rebuke you. For ye ſpeak here the viſion of your own heart, and not from the mouth of the Lord: And ye are not the firſt that hath blaſphemed the truth of God; for ſo did the <hi>Jewes</hi> before you, call the doctrine of the Goſpel, <hi>a ſect, a hereſie;</hi> and the Gentiles called it <hi>ſtrange Gods, and a new doctrine;</hi> and the preachers thereof, a <hi>ſetter forth of ſtrange Gods, and of new doctrine, and a babler, Acts</hi> 28. <hi>and</hi> 14. <hi>and</hi> 17. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid, that Chriſt had a Devil; and yet as our Lord teſtifies, it was they that were the children of the Devil, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. Ye ſay that we preach a new Evangel, and old &amp; new hereſies; but this is the ſin &amp; the doctrine of your Church: For to let that paſs of that <hi>new &amp; everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> which your Friers invented &amp; devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as teſtifieth <hi>Guliel. de ſancto Amore,</hi> in his book <hi>de peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul. noviſſ temp. anno</hi> 1192. wherein was contained ſuch blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, as the heaven and earth abhorrs to hear them: <hi>That God the Father reigned under the law: God the Son under grace: And the holy Ghoſt was then that year to begin his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to continue to the end of the world. And that Jeſus Chriſt was not God, his Sacrament nothing, and his Evangel not a true Evangel.</hi> (O horrible blaſphemie) the which if God had not raiſed up ſome men in thoſe days to have reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted it, as the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and others which ye call hereticks and infamous men, the Goſpel of Chriſt had been loſt; and in ſtead of it, we would have gotten a new Goſpel, the dreggs whereof yet remains in your Church. But I will let this paſs, becauſe the wiſe men of <hi>Babel</hi> (I mean your Clergy of Rome) ſaw that that was too plain an ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, therefore they cauſed it quietlie to be removed and buried, and yet they not condemned as hereticks that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched it. But by the contrary, the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and others that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106559:39"/> withſtood it, was condemned as hereticks, and their books burnt. To let this paſs, I ſay, which teſtifieth what the world might have looked for at your hands, if the Lord had not provided better for his poor Church Your whole doctrine is Antichriſtian, as ſhal be proved hereafter, your Church <hi>Babel, Rev.</hi> 17. your Kingdom <hi>that ſecond beast, Rev.</hi> 13.11. <hi>that hath two horns like the Lamb, and yet ſpeaks like the dragon;</hi> and your head, <hi>the man of ſin,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>and ſon of perdition.</hi> And ye are they that have renewed old condemned hereſies, and have invented new of your own, as ſhal be proved afterward, by Gods grace.</p>

                  <p>I will follow your footſteps, and firſt anſwer to that part which ye ſay is true, and then unto that which ye ſay is falſe. And as to the firſt, the ground which ye laid down, whereupon ye go about to build the truth of your Religion, is the Church of Chriſt ſhal never fail, nor be in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terrupted,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106559:40"/> &amp;c. It is recorded in Hiſtories, <hi>Athenaeus dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſophiſt lib.</hi> 12. of one <hi>Thraſilaus</hi> a frantick man among the Greeks, whenſoever he ſaw any ſhips arrive at the haven of <hi>Athens,</hi> he thought them all his own, and took an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventarie of their wares, and met them with great joy: Even ſo it is with you, whereſoever you ſee the name of the Church in the holy Scripture, &amp; the promiſes of God made unto the ſame, ye take all to be yours, and books the treaſures of it, and boaſts thereof, as though they were your own, crying, The gates of hell ſhal never prevail againſt it: It ſhal never fail: It hath always the holy Ghoſt to lead it in all truth. To remove you therefore out of the haven, and to give every merchant his own ware, and his own ſhip, and to ſet the Church it ſelf in poſſeſſion of the Church, we muſt diſtinguiſh the name of the Church. The Church therefore is taken ſometimes for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of the elect and choſen, whereof a part is in heaven triumphing with Chriſt their Lord; a part here in the earth fighting her battels, lying in her camp, and awaiting for the victorie. And theſe are termed the inviſible Church, becauſe Gods election cannot be diſcerned by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mans ſenſes or eyes, and we cannot know who are his choſen. And unto this Church, that is, to the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, appertains all the promiſes ſet down in the Scripture, and in them only are they fulfilled: And ſometimes it is taken for the company of them who profeſſes the true Religion, wherein both the chaff and the wheat, the pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the good ſeed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.12. <hi>and</hi> 13.24.25 the dregs and the wine, the good and the evil are mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the which ſuppoſe they be in the Church, yet they are not of the Church, no more then the ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the bodie are true and livelie members thereof. So then if ye mean by the Church, <hi>The Church of the elect,</hi> and if ye mean by this, <hi>That it ſhal never fail, nor be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106559:40"/> &amp;c. only this, that it ſhal never be utterly aboliſhed, but ſhal have alwayes the preſence of the holy Ghoſt to lead her in all truth, yea and in all holineſs alſo, in ſo far, as ſhal ſerve for her ſalvation: We grant that with you, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confeſſeth of us; and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Eccleſ. milit. cap.</hi> 13. <hi>That many of their number ſpend but time, while as they go about to prove that the Church here beneath abſolutelie cannot periſh, or make abſolute defection: for Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and the reſt of the hereticks grant that, but they ſpeak and mean</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the inviſible Church.</hi> So if ye mean no further but this, then <hi>Bellarmin</hi> telleth you that all the teſtimonies of Scripture and Fathers, that ye have hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up here to prove the ſame, is but to ſpend the time, &amp; ſo are fetched as needleſs witneſſes in a matter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>at is not doubt ſome, or called in queſtion. And if ye had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his language, ye needed not to have cumbred your ſelf in fetching of this mortar and ſtone to build up your <hi>Babel:</hi> For this was not required at your hands. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>Babel</hi> which ye are bigging, a tower of confuſion, therefore the Lord hath ſent ſuch a confuſion of language among you, that few of you underſtands what another ſayes; when ſome cryes for mortar, others brings ſtone. <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> the great maiſter-builder, cryes for proofs to prove that the <hi>viſible Church here beneath cannot err, neither in the matters which are needful to ſalvation, neither in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which are not needful, which ſhe propones to be believed or to be done, whither they be doctrine contained in the Scripture or</hi> extra ſcripturam, <hi>that is, not contained in the Scripture.</hi> He cryes to prove that, and ye cumber your ſelf in bringing in a number of Scriptures to prove that the Church ſhal alwayes remain till the end of the world; whereas in the examination of your proofs, it will be found that they will go no further with you. But if ye mean of the viſible Church, that it ſhal never fail, &amp;c. that is, it ſhal never fail
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106559:41"/> in doctrine, nor be interrupted in the ſame, not only in the matters needful to ſalvation, but in all truth, as ye affirm of your Church, and as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſayes, as hath been ſaid before. If ye go this far, as ye do indeed, and as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth and your ſelf muſt do, if ye be a right defender of your Catholick faith here, or elſe there is no ground whereupon ye can build the puretie and truth of your Church and Religion. Then I ſay, that your ground is as falſe and erroneous, as the ſtuff that ye build upon it; for both they have failed, and have been interrupted, as ſhal be proved afterward. And mark this, Chriſtian reader, as the Philiſtins Church wherein they praiſed their God, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. and mocked <hi>Samſon</hi> the Lords ſervant, had two chief pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars whereon the whole houſe leaned and was born up, ſo hath the Church of Rome two chief pillars, whereon the whole weight of their Church and Religion hings: the one whereof is this, that the Church cannot err: the other, that the Pope is the head of the Church. Take theſe two from them, their houſe muſt fall, and their Religion can ſtand no longer. For when they are brought to this ſtrait, that they ſee they cannot defend their Religion, neither by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Scripture, nor yet by the examples of the Church of God, when ſhe was in her greater purity and ſincerity, they are compelled to lay this as a ground to hold all their errors on, that the Church of Chriſt cannot err: So take this ground from them, their Church and Religion cannot ſtand.</p>
                  <p>Now, as to the teſtimonies which ye quote out of the Old Teſtament, &amp; out of <hi>Luke</hi> 1.33. in the New Teſtament, they only prove that the Church and Kingdom of Chriſt ſhal endure for evermore, and that his covenant made with her, is everlaſting. The which cannot exeem the militant Church from erring in points of doctrine; for both the chaff and evil ſeed in the Church, that is, theſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106559:41"/> that are called, but not choſen, may err, and that to death and damnation, and yet his Church and Kingdom, and his covenant, remaineth ſure, ſtable, and inviolate: for the Lord only offers his covenant unto them, and they through incredulitie reject it, and ſo he is not bound to ſanctifie or ſave them, much leſs to keep them from error. And as for theſe who are called and choſen, all theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are made and performed in every one of them, and the covenant of God is ſo ſure in every one of them, that our Savior ſaith, <hi>None of them can periſh, John</hi> 10.28. And yet for all this, every one of them may err in doctrine, ſuppoſe not to death and damnation, which ye will not deny. And if ye would, infinit examples not only of the Saints of God, of the laicks (as ye call them) but alſo of the Prieſts, Prophets, Apoſtles, yea and of Popes alſo, and of your own Doctors and Biſhops, as a cloud of witneſſes, would ſtand up and avow the ſame in your face. Now I gather, ſeeing that the militant Church here on earth hath but two ſorts of perſons in her, theſe that are called and choſen, and theſe that are only called, but not choſen, and both may err in points of doctrine, the one finally to death and damnation: the other may err, ſuppoſe not finally to death and damnation: and yet the covenant of God remain ſure, everlaſting, and inviolate with his Church. Therefore, I ſay, the promiſes of the ſtabilitie of Chriſts Kingdom, and the perpetuitie of his covenant made with her, cannot exeem the militant Church from erring in points of doctrine. So ye have loſt your vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard. Let us come to the reſt, and ſee if they will favor your cauſe any better then the former hath done.</p>
                  <p>The next place ye quote is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhal not prevail againſt it.</hi> And becauſe ye truſt that there is not a teſtimony of Scripture which ſhal fight more for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106559:42"/> you then this, let us therefore try it to the uttermoſt, and ſee how far it can be ſtretched out. What argument will ye frame out of this place? For if you gather no more but this, Chriſt hath promiſed that the gates of hell ſhal never prevail againſt the Church that is built on the Rock, that is, on Chriſt: Therefore the Church that is built on him, ſhal never be all utterlie extinguiſhed and aboliſhed by Satan. Then <hi>Bellarmin</hi> tells you that ye ſpend but time in proving of this: for we grant it, That the Church of the choſen ſhal never periſh. But if you go further, and ſay; That the Church of Chriſt ſhal never err, becauſe Chriſt hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that the gates of hell ſhal not prevail againſt it: then, I ſay, either that expoſition is falſe, or elſe the gates of hell ſhould have prevailed long ſince againſt your Church: for when it prevailed againſt the rock whereon the Church was built, it prevailed againſt the Church. For raze and overturn the foundation of a houſe, the houſe cannot ſtand, ſeeing the ſtanding of the houſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts on the firmneſs &amp; ſureneſs of the foundation thereof. Now the rock whereon ye ſay the Church is built, unto whom this promiſe is made, is <hi>Peter and his ſucceſſors the Popes of Rome,</hi> for ſo ye all with one conſent expone the ſame. <hi>Rhemiſts annotation upon this place.</hi> Seeing then that they are the foundation of the Church, as ye ſay, and the gates of hell hath prevailed againſt them, as I ſhal prove, by the grace of God: it muſt follow, if your expoſition be true, that the gates of hell hath prevailed, not once only, but at many times againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Church.</p>
                  <p>For, firſt, <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf erred in a matter of doctrine, when he thought with the reſt of the Apoſtles after the reſurrection of Chriſt, the Kingdom of Chriſt not to be heavenlie but earthlie; not ſpiritual, but like the Kingdoms of this world, proper to Iſrael, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.6. not common to all, by vertue of the promiſe: and alſo he is commanded
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106559:42"/> to preach the Goſpel to the Gentils, <hi>doubting nothing, Acts</hi> 10.20. Which teſtifies, that he doubted before, whither the Goſpel ſhould be preached to them or not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore erred in a matter of faith, and that after he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the promiſe of the holy Ghoſt. And alſo he erred in the abrogation of the Ceremonial Law, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.14. for he believed that ſome meats were unclean after the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, and therefore he refuſed to eat thereof. And this was a matter of faith alſo. And laſt of all, the holy Ghoſt teſtifies, that <hi>he went not a right foot to the truth of the Goſpel, Gal.</hi> 2.11. and therefore was rebuked by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to his face. And as for them whom ye call his ſucceſſors, the Popes of Rome, not only may they be hereticks, but alſo ſome of them have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. And therefore if your argument be good, the gates of hell both may, and have prevailed againſt them. That they may be hereticks, I will fetch no other witneſſes, but your own Councils, Canons, Cardinals, and your own Popes; for they ſhal be your Judges in this matter. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>de Rom.

I omit the reſt. Seeing then theſe whom ye call the rock and foundation of your Church have erred, and that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of doctrine and Religion, and in the principal points thereof, and that by the teſtimonies both of the Scripture, and of your own Councils, Doctors, Cardinals, and Popes. Therefore if your argument hold forth, then I ſay, the gates of hell hath prevailed againſt your Church, becauſe they have prevailed againſt the rocks and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof; for they have erred, as hath been proved; the which, I ſuppoſe, ye will not grant. And therefore the furtheſt that ye can gather here, is but this; That the gates of hell, that is, the power of condemnation ſhal
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106559:43"/> not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; that is, totally and finally overcome: So that ſuppoſe they may <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is be ſtrong, and make them to fail in many things, yet they cannot prevail totally and finally againſt the Church of God, that is, the elect and choſen, who are built not on the Pope, but on the immoveable Rock the Lord Jeſus. I ſay further, this promiſe is made and performed in every one of the elect: For the gates of hell ſhal not prevail; that is, get the final and full victory over any of them. And therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior ſaith, <hi>None of my ſheep ſhal periſh, John</hi> 10 28. and yet ye will not deny, but every one of the elect may err. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this promiſe doth not priviledge the Church of God from erring, but the chaff and evil ſeed; that is theſe that are called and not choſen, may err, and err finally; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this promiſe is not made unto them, for they are not built upon this Rock, but upon the ſand: for none is built upon this Rock, but theſe who <hi>are bleſſed, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the word, and doth it, Matth.</hi> 7. as our Savior teſtifieth. And the good ſeed, which are theſe that are called and choſen, may err, ſuppoſe not finally and totally.</p>
                  <p>The next place which ye quote, is that prayer of Chriſt for <hi>Peter, Luke</hi> 22.32. <hi>But I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not, Matth.</hi> 26. It is true he prayed. It is true alſo that <hi>Peters</hi> faith failed not; but yet it ſwooned, as it were, when he denyed his Lord, and that by perjuring and curſing of himſelf; and yet he erred both in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of Chriſts Kingdom, in the calling of the Gentils, and in the abrogation of the Ceremonial Law, <hi>Acts</hi> 10 14. As alſo, he went not rightly to the truth of the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11. as hath been proved. So this prayer was not that he ſhould be kept abſolutely from all erring; for then it ſhal follow, that Chriſt obtained not that which he prayed for: ſeeing he erred (which is impious to think) but that his faith ſhould not decay finally and totally.</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:106559:44"/>
                  <p>Secondly, the Lord Jeſus prayed alſo for all believers, <hi>John</hi> 17.18.19.20. which place ye alſo quote, and yet there is not one of the believers but they may err, as your ſelves cannot deny, and we have proved by examples of your own Popes: for if any were exeemed from erring, in your judgement it ſhould be theſe that are the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Church, which ye call your Popes; but they may err, and have erred, as hath been proved.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I ſay, it will not follow, Chriſt prayed for <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> faith that it ſhould not fail: Therefore he prayed for the Popes, whom ye will have to be ſucceſſors to <hi>Peter,</hi> that their faith ſhould not fail (for that is the thing ye would be at) for their faith hath failed. For if by faith ye underſtand the doctrine of the faith of Chriſt, as it is taken ſometimes in the Scripture, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. then I ſay your own Doctors, Canons, Councils, Cardinals, and Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as they have been cited before, teſtifieth, that not only they may err, but alſo that ſome of them have erred, and have been hereticks. And if by that faith which our Lord prayed for, ye underſtand that lively faith that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth the promiſes of Gods mercie in Chriſt, which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by love, and ſhoweth forth the ſelf by good works; as by keeping of Chriſts commandments, and by loving one another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. 1. <hi>John</hi> 2.4. Then I ſay, your own writers, friends, favorers, and Cardinals te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth of them, <hi>Platin, Genebrard, Crantz,</hi> that <hi>they have gone from Peters ſteps, that they got the Popedom by brybery and bargaining with the Devil: That they were monſtrous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious men; yea, rather beasts and monsters.</hi> So that of all men that ever profeſſed the faith of Jeſus, they have failed moſt foully in that lively faith, as I have proved in another place concerning the Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>As to that place which ye quote <hi>John</hi> 14.16.17. where the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt is promiſed to the Apoſtles to dwel with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106559:44"/> them, and to remain with them for ever:</hi> And in the 16. <hi>chap. verſ</hi> 13. that <hi>he ſhal lead them in all truth.</hi> I anſwer, firſt, that was the Apoſtles prerogative, the Maiſter-builders of the Church of Chriſt, that in writing and teaching the doctrine of ſalvation, they ſhould be led in all truth, and in none ever ſince promiſed nor performed in that high meaſure. Secondly, this promiſe <hi>of the Spirit of truth to dwel and remain in them for ever, and to lead them in all truth,</hi> is made and performed in all believers, in ſo far as may ſanctifie them and ſave them: and yet ye will not deny, but that every one of the believers may err Therefore this promiſe will not reach ſo far as to keep the Church from impoſſibility of erring.</p>
                  <p>As to that place in the 17. of <hi>John,</hi> I anſwered to it before.</p>
                  <p>As to the 28. of <hi>Matthew, I will be with you to the end of the world;</hi> I anſwer the ſame thing to it, which I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the former, that this promiſe is made, not to any viſible and ordinar ſucceſſion (for that is to ty the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God to perſons and places) but to the Paſtors of the Church whom he ſends forth, and to all the faithful: and is performed in them, in ſo far forth as may ſave them, and inable them for his work. But yet this will not exeem them from all poſſibility of erring.</p>
                  <p>As to that in the 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. the Church is called the <hi>pillar and ground of truth,</hi> therefore ye gather, It cannot err. Firſt, I will ask you to whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks ſo, and upon what occaſion he ſpeaks it? Ye muſt ſay, To <hi>Timothie,</hi> that <hi>he might know how to behave himſelf in the houſe of God, which is the Church,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14. for ſo the Apoſtle writes. Then I ask, Is not that Church wherein <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> ſhould have behaved himſelf, called the <hi>ground and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of truth?</hi> So the Scripture calls it, and ye cannot deny it. Now this Church was the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> then
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106559:45"/> the <hi>Church of Epheſus</hi> is called, the <hi>ground and pillar of truth.</hi> But firſt, the Church of <hi>Epheſus fell from her firſt love, and the candleſtick is threatned to be removed from her, unleſs ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, Rev.</hi> 2.5. She did not repent, but in time became worſe and worſe, and ſo heaped fault upon fault, till Chriſt hath now removed his candleſtick from her, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her over to darkneſs and death, by taking his own elect to himſelf and giving over the reprobat that hated the truth, to the blindneſs of their own mind: ſo that city is left deſolat to the impiety of Mahomet; and ſhe that was once called by Gods Spirit, <hi>the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> hath now loſt the truth. Now, I ſay, that which may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall one Church, may befall any other Church: Then that which is befallen to the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> may befall any other: But the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was firſt craiſed, and then by little and little utterly overthrown: and being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft of the light of Chriſt, is now a Church no longer. Therefore, I ſay, that there is no Church on the face of the earth, howſoever they flatter themſelves with glorious ſtyles of Catholick, pillars and ground of the truth: whoſe body (that is, the elect and choſen in it) may not be overſhadowed with darkneſs, and overtaken with faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: whoſe chaff, that is, the hypocrits in it, may not be wholly conſumed with rottenneſs and deſtruction, and whoſe whole frame and outward government, may not looſe both their ſtrength and beauty.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I ſay, if the Church cannot err, as ye ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the ground and pillar of truth; and if the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> be called the pillar and ground of truth, as the Scripture ſaith; and ſeeing the Church of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> with all the Churches of the Eaſt (as ye cannot deny) hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Popes ſupremacy as hereſie: Therefore one of theſe two muſt follow, either that the Church; that is, the pillar and ground of the truth, not only may err, but
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106559:45"/> hath erred; or elſe it is an hereſie condemned many hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred years ago, <hi>That the Pope is the head of the Church,</hi> &amp; ſo Popery is hereſie. Judge ye which of theſe ye will chooſe. Laſt of all, I ſay, the Church is called the pillar and ground of truth, becauſe it is her office and duty <hi>to hold out the word of truth, as lanterns and light, Philip.</hi> 2.16. by preaching it, and practiſing it; as the Prieſt is called, the <hi>Meſſenger of the Lord of hosts, becauſe his lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, and declare the meſſage of God, Malach.</hi> 2.7. But as there were Prieſts which ſhew not forth the meſſage of God, but cauſed many to err in the Law, and corrupted the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of <hi>Levi;</hi> ſo there may be Churches, and have been, which have not upheld, and maintained the truth, but have fallen therefrom.</p>
                  <p>Now I come to your laſt teſtimony of Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.39 In that counſel of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> to the Council of the Scribes and Phariſies, That <hi>if the doctrine of the Apostles be of God, that it cannot be deſtroyed.</hi> What do you gather here? That the truth doth remain for ever? <hi>Bellarmin</hi> telleth you, that ye ſpend but time in proving that; for we grant it unto you. It cannot (I grant) be deſtroyed, but yet it can be perſecuted and removed out of places where it was before, and obſcured and corrupted by mens gloſſes and traditions, as it hath been theſe 1500. years by the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom this was ſpoken. That if the doctrine of the Apoſtles was of God, they could not deſtroy it: and yet (as was ſaid) they baniſhed it, and made the Lord to deprive them thereof, and to give them over to the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and hardneſs of their hearts, becauſe they would not embrace the truth when it was offered.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then there is not a ſyllab in Gods Word that will uphold this main foundation of your Church <hi>(that the Church cannot err)</hi> take heed to your ſelf, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> in time, and build not the damnation of your own ſoul, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106559:46"/> the damnation of the ſouls of many others, upon a point of doctrine that hath not God to bear witneſs to it in the whole Scripture. I might end here; but becauſe this point (as I ſaid before) is the main pillar that upholds the whole weight of their Church and Religion: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will utterly overthrow the ſame, and I will prove out of the Word of God, <hi>That the Church in all ages, both may err, and hath erred.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And firſt, the Scripture teſtifieth, that it is only proper to God alone by nature to be perfectly holy, and true, and free from all errors, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.18. And contrariwiſe, man by nature is unholy, a liar, prone to deceive, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4 9.10.11.17. <hi>and</hi> 19. <hi>verſ.</hi> ſo that by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he is nothing elſe but a maſs of blindneſs and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that the light he hath, he hath it by free grace, by Gods Spirit, to make him ſee ſo much of his light in the face of Chriſt, as may ſave him. But yet ſo long as they are in this houſe of clay, they ſee but in part; &amp; that part which they ſee, is <hi>but obſcurely and dimly,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. So that as long as they are in this world, they are ſubject to ſin, ignorance and errors. But as there are two ſorts of men in the viſible Church, ſome called and choſen, ſome called, and not choſen; and as in the diſeaſes of the body, ſome are curable, whereof men recovers; ſome are deadly, whereof men dies: ſo it is in the errors of the militant Church, ſome are deadly, &amp; ſome are curable. The choſen that are called, may err, but their errors are not deadly, as the errors of the Apoſtles were, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.6. <hi>and</hi> 10. <hi>and</hi> 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. <hi>and</hi> 22. they recovered by grace from them. The called that are not choſen, may err, and err deadly, and never recover; as theſe of whom <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh; <hi>They went out from us</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe they were not of us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 2.19. Now ſeeing the viſible Church here beneath ſtands but of theſe two ſorts, to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106559:46"/> wit, of theſe that are called and choſen, and theſe that are called, but not choſen, and both may err. Therefore it is manifeſt, that the Church militant here beneath, may err. And to prove this more amply, that ſhe hath erred before the Law, under the Law, in Chriſts time, and after Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Adam</hi> being made in perfect holineſs and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie, how grievouſly did he err, when contrarie Gods commandment, giving more credit to the Devil then to his Maker, he brake that firſt covenant? For <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who will doubt to call Adams fall an hereſie, Contra Marcionem, lib.</hi> 1. Now if <hi>Adam</hi> in his full light did not ſtand, but ſo foullie erred, which is he that is come forth of his loyns, born in ignorance and blindneſs, that dare challenge this prerogative to himſelf, that he cannot err, except the man of ſin, and ſon of perdition? that is, the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now, he being thruſt out of Paradiſe, hath two ſons: the elder <hi>Cain,</hi> for the murther of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is accurſed of God, and the author of the Synagogue of <hi>Babel,</hi> that is the wicked. The Church of God remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the poſteritie of <hi>Seth, Gen.</hi> 5. and at the laſt, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion began to be ſo prophaned, that at length it grew to ſuch a hight, that Religion being contracted only in the familie of <hi>Noah,</hi> it could be puniſhed with no leſs then with an univerſal deſtruction of all living creatures by the flood, except only theſe that were preſerved in the <hi>Ark</hi> with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. Of <hi>Noahs</hi> three children, two of them fell, both themſelves and their poſterity. The true Church and Religion remained in the family of <hi>Sem;</hi> and neither were they free from Idolatrie, God calling, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. <hi>Abraham</hi> out of his own countrey, ſerving ſtrange Gods, <hi>Joſu.</hi> 24.2.3. His eldeſt ſon <hi>Iſmael</hi> being circumciſed, is commanded to be caſten out of the Church of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.12. <hi>and</hi> 25.23. <hi>and</hi> 31.34. <hi>and</hi> 35.2. <hi>Iſaac</hi> hath two ſons, the elder is refuſed, the youngeſt is choſen, and ſo the elder with his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106559:47"/> poſteritie fell away. <hi>Jacobs</hi> familie was not clean, neither from Idolatrie, being polluted with ſtrange Gods by his wife <hi>Rachel,</hi> till he cleanſed his houſe. And as for his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, what ſtiff-neckedneſs, what rebellion, what Idolatrie was among them, ſo that no threatning no bleſſing, no correction, nor teaching, could keep them in the puritie of Gods worſhip and Religion?</p>
                  <p>In the Church under the Law, the people are Idolaters, the hie-Prieſt <hi>Aaron</hi> the maker of the Idol to the people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. In the time of the Judges after the death of <hi>Joſua,</hi> they worſhipped <hi>Baal</hi> and ſtrange Gods, <hi>Judges</hi> 1.12.13. and every man did that which ſeemed good in his own eyes, when there was not a King in Iſrael, which was very oft in thoſe dayes, and therefore they are given over to the crueltie and tyrannie of their enemies round about them. In the time of <hi>Heli, there was no open viſion,</hi> 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 3.1. And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Where there is no viſion, the people periſh, Prov.</hi> 29.18. In <hi>Sauls</hi> time the Ark of the Lord was not ſought, 1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 13.3. and ſo there wanted a chief part of the publick worſhip of God: for God was conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Ark. And in the time of <hi>Solomon,</hi> in his old age, when his heart was turned from the Lord, the Scripture teſtifieth, that <hi>they forſook the Lord, and worſhipped ſtrange Gods of the Ammonites,</hi> 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 11. Such like in the time of <hi>Rehoboam, Solomons</hi> ſon, <hi>Juda</hi> committed Idolatrie, and built hie places, wherein they worſhipped contrary to Gods commandment. <hi>Jehoram</hi> King of <hi>Juda,</hi> made <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to commit ſpiritual fornication and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 14 22.23 as the houſe of <hi>Ahab</hi> made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to commit Idolatrie. Seeing then the worſhip of God was corrupted both in <hi>Juda</hi> and in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and there was no other viſible Churches upon the earth, except in <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> will it not follow then, that all the particular Churches on the earth may err, and fall alſo to Idolatrie?
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106559:47"/> Such like in the time of <hi>Achaz,</hi> a ſtrange altar is placed in the temple of the Lord, at the commandment of the King, by <hi>Vriah</hi> the Prieſt: and the King with the whole people, at the Kings commandment, offers upon that altar, and the altar of the Lord is removed out of his place, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 16.10.11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the time of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> both the King and the Nobilitie forſake the houſe of the Lord, and worſhip Idols, ſo that the hot wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for their Idolatrie, 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 24. Such like in the time of <hi>Achaz,</hi> he made hie places in all the corners of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in all the cities of <hi>Juda,</hi> and there burnt incenſe to ſtrange Gods, 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 28. In the time of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> the whole publick worſhip of God was ſo defaced, and Idolatrie ſo univerſallie ſet up, that the Scriptures teſtifie, <hi>Juda ſinned more hainouſlie then the very nations did whom the Lord caſt out before their face, Chron.</hi> 33.9. The whole hoſt of heaven was worſhipped in ſtead of the true God. I beſeech thee (Reader) to read this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and there thou ſhalt find that there was not ſo much as an outward face of a Church at that time. Yea, in the very time of good Kings, as <hi>Joaſh</hi> and <hi>Amaſia,</hi> who both in the beginning embraced the worſhip of God, but yet made defection in the end. The <hi>hie places</hi> were not removed, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 12.3.4. <hi>and</hi> 14.4. which was an error in the worſhip of God. The Scripture teſtifies that the feaſt of the Paſſover was not kept ſo preciſelie, according to the Word of God ſince the days of <hi>Samuel,</hi> no not in the reign of the beſt Kings, as it was in the 18. year of <hi>Joſias, Chr.</hi> 35.18. and there was 400. years and more between. Alſo the Scripture teſtifieth that the feaſt of the Tabernacles was not ſo kept, as it was then ſince the dayes of <hi>Joſua,</hi> which was more then a thouſand years, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.18. And all the time of the captivitie, where was there any publick face of the Church of God, with his publick worſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106559:48"/> in all things as the Lord commanded it? As concerning the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from the time of their renting aſunder by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> from the Kingdom of <hi>Juda,</hi> they never had the worſhip of God in integritie; but firſt worſhipped God in the places where they ſhould not have worſhipped him, and after another manner, and by other Prieſts then they were commanded. Next, they fell to the worſhipping of Idols, till they were tranſported out of their land, and ſcattered upon the face of the earth. What, ſhal I purſue the ſayings of the Prophets, how the only viſible Church in the world, is called <hi>an harlot, Iſai.</hi> 1. the Temple a <hi>den of thieves, Jer.</hi> 7. the <hi>Prophets all blind guides, and dumb dogs that cannot bark? Iſai.</hi> 57.10.11. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Now when God of his infinit mercy ſent his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son in the world, the light, the life, the ſalvation of the world, what did the Church and the Clergie, the Scribes and the Phariſies that <hi>ſate in the chair of Moſes? Mat.</hi> 23. Surely Chriſt had none ſo great enemies as they were, who were the Doctors, the lights, the ſucceſſors of <hi>Aaron,</hi> to whom the Law was concredited. When Chriſt teſtified of himſelf that he was the light of the world, they ſaid, <hi>his teſtimony was not true, John</hi> 8.13. When others belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in him, they ſaid <hi>they were deceived, John</hi> 7.47. They or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, <hi>that if any man ſhould confeſs Chriſt, he ſhould be exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat, John</hi> 9.22. So that <hi>many that did believe in him, durſt not for them confeſs him, John</hi> 12.42. They watched him, of purpoſe that they might have matter of accuſation againſt him, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.7. And when he caſt out Devils, the Scribes and the Phariſies ſaid, that <hi>he did caſt out Devils by Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub the Prince of Devils, Mark</hi> 3.22. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.24. They ſaid, they found <hi>him a man perverting the nation, and forbidding to pay tribut to Ceſar, Luke</hi> 32.2. They condemn him in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Council as worthy of death, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.64. Yea, as Chriſt teſtifies of them, they <hi>neither entred in the Kingdom of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106559:48"/> heaven themſelves, nor ſuffered others to enter in, Mat.</hi> 23.13. And yet they are theſe, that if ye look to their antiquitie, they have their beginning from <hi>Abraham:</hi> if to their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, they ſucceeded to <hi>Aaron:</hi> if to their callings, they were Scribes and Phariſies, and ſate in the <hi>chair of Moſes, Mat.</hi> 23 if to the place, it was to the houſe of God: if to the people whom they taught, they were the only people of God: if to their prerogatives, to them appertained <hi>the adoption, and the glorie, and the covenant, and the giving of the law, and the ſervice of God, and the promiſes, of whom are the Fathers, and of whom is Chriſt according to the fleſh, who is God over all bleſſed forever. Amen. Rom.</hi> 9.4.5. And if ye will look to their Council, they were ſolemnlie called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where they condemned the Lord of life, and <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Prince of glorie.</hi> What can you ſay to theſe? That they erred in the perſon of Chriſt, but not in the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Law, (as ſome of you ſaith) But firſt, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes did write of Christ, John</hi> 5.46. and <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law, Rom.</hi> 10.4. So that if they had not erred in expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Law, they had not erred in the perſon of Chriſt, becauſe the Law teſtified of Chriſt, &amp; he was the end of it. Next, the Scripture teſtifies that they erred in exponing of the Law, that <hi>they both brake the Law, and teached others ſo to do, Mat.</hi> 5. And therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Except your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſies, ye cannot enter in the Kingdom of heaven, Mat.</hi> 5.20. For whereas the Law of God counts hatred murther, and luſt adultery, and raſh ſwearing unlawful ſwearing, and our enemies our neighbors, whom we ought to love and to do good unto: They by the contrary, taught that our friends was only our neighbors whom we ſhould love, and therefore they ſaid, that <hi>we ſhould hate our enemies, verſ.</hi> 43. That hatred was not the breaking of the ſixth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and luſt no breaking of the ſeventh command,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106559:49"/> and raſh ſwearing no breaking of the third command. And therefore the Lord Jeſus in that fifth chapter of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> doth vindicat the true meaning of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from their falſe expoſitions. And he teſtifies of them, that <hi>they did abrogat the Law of God through their tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and ſo <hi>in vain they worſhipped God, teaching for Gods Law</hi> (which he calls doctrine) <hi>mens precepts, Mat.</hi> 15.6. which he proves there by an example of abrogating and annulling of that duty which we ow to father and mother, commanded us in the fifth commandment, by their tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therefore he gives charge to his diſciples <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the leaven</hi> (that is the doctrine) <hi>of the Phariſies, Mat.</hi> 15.6. Seeing then they who had their ordinary ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from <hi>Aaron</hi> erred, how can the Doctors of your Church, yea, your Popes be priviledged from erring? But it may be ye grant all this; for how can ye deny it, that the Church before the Law, under the Law, in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the time of the Judges, in the time of the Kings, in the time of the captivitie, and in the time of Chriſt, erred: but yet the Chriſtian Church hath greater priviledges and promiſes that it cannot err? Let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this alſo, whither the Chriſtian Church be privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged from erring, or not. And certainlie, if any Chriſtian Church, at any time had this prerogative, appearantlie the primitive Church which was in the dayes of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles, ſhould have had it. But they had it not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what Church ſince under the heaven can challenge it? For in the time of Chriſts ſuffering, the Apoſtles and Diſciples, who only then were the Chriſtian Church, yea, after that they had been Apoſtles, and after that they had been ſent to preach the Goſpel, and work miracles, yet in that time, did they not err in the article of Chriſts reſurrection? <hi>Mat.</hi> 10 And erred they not concerning the eſtat of Chriſts kingdom after the reſurrection? <hi>Acts</hi> 1.6.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106559:49"/> 
                     <hi>and</hi> 11. And concerning the teaching of the Gentils, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had received the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. And <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, as hath been ſhown. And ſundrie Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, as <hi>Alex.

Now to go forward, did not the Church of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> err in building hay and ſtubble on the foundation, and in the uſe of the Lords Supper, and ſome of them alſo concerning the reſurrection of the dead, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>and</hi> 11. <hi>and</hi> 15. And the Church of <hi>Galatia</hi> erred in being carried away to another Goſpel, and in joyning the Ceremonies of the law with grace in juſtification, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>and</hi> 3. And what will ye ſay when the hereſie of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> (who denied Chriſt to be the Son of God equal to his Father) ſpread its ſelf ſo far, that it is teſtified by <hi>Theodor. hist. Eccleſ. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; Hier. dial. contra Lucif. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp; in chron. Athanaſ. Epiſt. de Synod.

I mean not now of them that have profeſſed Mahometiſm, but of them that admits the Scripture, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges Chriſt their Savior, who have their ordinar ſucceſſion of Patriarks and Biſhops, as well as your Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath, who in number far exceeds theſe Churches which acknowledges your Pope to be the head of the Church. For firſt, yours is but in Europe, except ye will claim to the New-found land, and not all Europe; for all the Churches in Greece, which is a great part of Europe, acknowledges not your ſupremacy. Now take the Greek Churches from you; next, the Reformed Churches in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106559:50"/> 
                     <hi>Scotland, England, Germany<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Denmark, France, Zeland, Holland,</hi> and other places, which have gone out of <hi>Babel,</hi> which are all in Europe, your number will not be many that acknowledges your ſupremacy. And next, take all <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> from you, which is the two parts of the world, your number will be ſmal, in compariſon of theſe that are againſt your ſupremacy. Now all theſe deteſts your ſupremacy as tyranny, and the worſhip of Images, your tranſubſtantiation in the Sacrament, the Communion under one kind, the ſingle life of Prieſts. Either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye muſt grant that the greateſt number of Chriſtian Churches have erred, and doth err, or elſe that your Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church doth err and your ſupremacy; yea, your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which depends upon your ſupremacy, is the head of hereſie. But it may be ye will ſay, that all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches may err, but that it is only proper to your Church not to err. Firſt, therefore let me ask at you what can be the cauſe of that ſingular priviledge which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath beſide all other Churches which ever have been, is, or ſhal be? Yea, above <hi>Adam</hi> when he was in his integrity (for he erred;) yea, above the Angels, for they <hi>remained not in the truth, Jude</hi> 6 Above the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarcks, <hi>Abraham. Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob:</hi> yea above <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the Church in the wilderneſs: above the Church under the Law: yea above the Apoſtles, and <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts ſuffering, in the time of his ſuffering, after the reſurrection, after the receiving of the holy Ghoſt; for they erred in all theſe times: Yea, above the Chriſtian Churches that have been founded by the Apoſtles, as well as yours; that had the promiſe, the covenant, the ſervice of God once in as great purity as ever yours had; that have their ordinar ſucceſſion, their antiquity, their vocation or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinar, as well as yours hath, unto this day. Great ſurely muſt be that priviledge given unto the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:106559:50"/> that hath exeemed her from error, others having erred. What is then your prerogative above all other Churches?</p>
                  <p>I know that ye will ſay, becauſe of <hi>Peters</hi> chair that was there wherein the Popes ſits after him. Firſt, then if <hi>Peters</hi> chair hath ſuch a prerogative, that the Paſtors who ſits in it, and the Church that cleaves to it, cannot err: I think ſurely the Lords chair which was at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was called the Temple and ſeat of God, and <hi>Moſes</hi> chair, wherein the Scribes and Phariſees ſate, ſhould rather have that prerogative to free the Churches and Paſtors ſitting in theſe chairs, from erring; yea, the Church which the truth it ſelf Jeſus Chriſt founded, whom he taught with his own mouth, and among whom he was crucified, ſhould with far greater right claim to that prerogative. But ſince all their ſeats have erred, for the <hi>Temple became a den of thieves:</hi> the Scribes and Phariſees that ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> chair, condemned the Lord of glory: and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf cryed out, <hi>Crucifie, crucifie him.</hi> And the Chriſtian Church ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered there, are long ſince far from the way of ſalvation. So that if neither the chair of God, nor <hi>Moſes,</hi> freed the Church of the Jews from erring, nor the chair of Chriſt freed the Chriſtian Church there gathered from erring: How then can <hi>Peters</hi> chair have this prerogative above them all, as to exeem that Church and Paſtors that ſits therein from poſſibility of erring? What is this but to prefer him before them all, whoſe ſeat hath a priviledge that neither God, nor his ſons, nor <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeat had? O high blaſphemy to be deteſted and abhorred of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hearts. But let us ſee if it hath this prerogative which they aſcribe unto it, or not. And firſt, if it could have exeemed any from erring, ſhould it not have exee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelf eſpecially from erring? But as it hath been ſhown he erred, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. therefore it cannot exeem neither his ſucceſſors, not yet the Church that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106559:51"/> them, from erring. Secondly, if it had exee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med any Church from erring, ſhould it not have exeemed the Church of <hi>Antiochia</hi> eſpecially; for ſurely <hi>Antiochia</hi> hath better right to claim to this prerogative then your Church hath? For firſt, it was <hi>Peters</hi> firſt ſeat. Next, the Scripture bears witneſs to it that he was there, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11. But neither was <hi>Rome Peters</hi> firſt ſeat, nor is there ſo much as a ſyllab in all the Scriptures, to prove that ever <hi>Peter</hi> was in <hi>Rome.</hi> But ſuppoſe <hi>Peter</hi> was there (for we will not examine this now) whither is this prerogative <hi>not to err,</hi> given to your head, that is, to the Popes, or to the body, that is, the people, or to both? If ye ſay to the head (as ye do indeed) then what will ye anſwer to your own Writers and Fathers, to your own Councils and Popes, to your own Canon Law, affirming <hi>that Popes may err, and be hereticks, and ſhould be depoſed, and are depoſed when they are manifeſt hereticks?</hi> (as hath been proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.) And what will ye ſay to your Popes that have been hereticks indeed, one of them an <hi>Arrian,</hi> another an <hi>Eutychian,</hi> the third a <hi>Nestorian,</hi> the fourth a <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist,</hi> the fifth depoſed as an heretick, the ſixth <hi>denying that the ſouls of the children of God ſaw Gods face while after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> the ſeventh <hi>denying life everlaſting,</hi> and others <hi>giving themſelves over in the hands of the Devil for the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> others <hi>repelling and abrogating the decrees of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors;</hi> others ſuch monſters and beaſts, ſo cruel to the dead and to the living, that your own friends calls them monſters, and affirms of one of them that the Devil ſhot him through while he was abuſing another mans wife, and ſo died without repentance? Dare you ſay, and would ye have the ſalvation of mens ſouls to lean to this point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not err which is the rock &amp; foundation of your Church, which above all others have erred moſt grievouſly? O malicious and cruel man, that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106559:51"/> the poor flock of Jeſus Chriſt, for whom he ſhed his blood, with ſuch hereſie and abomination. Then this prerogative is not granted to your Popes, the head and foundation of your Church. And ſurely if the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be turned up-ſide-down, and the head may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſenſleſs and dead, I ſee not how the houſe can ſtand, and the body can be whole: and one of your greateſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Pontif. cap.</hi> 3. that if <hi>the Pope err, of neceſſity,</hi> tota Eccleſia errabit, that is, <hi>the whole Church ſhal err.</hi> Upon the which I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, If the Pope may err, and hath erred, then the whole Church may err, and hath erred: (ſo <hi>Bellarmin</hi> one of the learnedeſt Papiſts that ever was, writ) But the firſt hath been proved by your own Doctors, Cardinals, Popes, Councils, Canon Law. <hi>Ergo,</hi> by your own doctrine the whole Church may err.</p>
                  <p>Here we might ſtay now and go no further; for this ſufficiently overthrows this point of your doctrine, that the Church ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not err, &amp; that by the confeſſion of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedeſt of your ſide. But yet I will purſue the reſt. If you ſay it is granted to the body, then it is either gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or to the Clergy. To the people, I ſuppoſe ye will not; for if your Popes may err, much more may your people err: And if the Apoſtles, &amp; other famous Churches may err, much more may your people err: yea, if not, it ſhould follow that your people were above their head the Pope, which I ſuppoſe ye wil not ſay. If ye ſay the Clergy, then either it muſt be your Doctors ſeverally by themſelves, or as they are gathered together in a Council. But as they are ſeveral, ye will not ſay. For your <hi>Bellarmin</hi> controverſies would convince you to the face: for almoſt there are few contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies which he handles (and he handles more then 300) but he brings in ſome of your own Writers diſſenting from him, and whom in many places he confutes. And I think
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106559:52"/> if Popes have not this priviledge, ſurely the Doctors of your Church ſeverally have not this priviledge. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de author. Concil. c.</hi> 11.) <hi>If a general Council err, then the whole Church may err, for it repreſents the whole Church.</hi> And therefore he brings this in as a reaſon to prove, <hi>That general Councils cannot err, becauſe the whole Church cannot err:</hi> For (ſaith he) <hi>the general Council repreſents the whole Church, therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err.</hi> Let us examine this: for if it be found that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils may err, ſurely your cauſe is gone. Firſt then, what will ye ſay to thirteen general Councils, whereof ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is utterly rejected, &amp; the other ſix are in part allowed, and in part rejected, which all have erred, as <hi>Bellarmin de Concilijs, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. confeſſeth. But it may be you anſwer, that theſe were not approved by the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore they might err, and have erred; but theſe Councils that are altogether allowed of him cannot err, nor have not erred. Indeed it is true that this is your doctrine, <hi>That neither general nor provincial Councils can err that is allowed by the Pope, Bellarm. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. <hi>and that general Councils lawfully conveaned may err, unleſs they follow the inſtructions of the Pope.</hi> And therefore <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith, <hi>cap.</hi> 11. that they <hi>may err three manner of wayes.</hi> 1. <hi>If in defining of any thing the Fathers of the Council diſſent from the Popes Legats.</hi> 2. <hi>If it be againſt the Popes inſtruction, ſuppoſe both the Fathers and the Legats of the Council agree together.</hi> 3. <hi>They may err before they have received the Popes confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and judgement, ſuppoſe all both Fathers and Legats conſent together; becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Popes judgement is the laſt, from the which no man may appeal, and he may approve and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the General Council, notwithſtanding of their conſent with his own Legats.</hi> And therefore he ſaith in another place, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Rom. Pontif. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>That the whole ſtrength or certainty of lawful Councils, depends only of the Pope.</hi> So
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106559:52"/> then this is your laſt refuge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All depends on his inſtruction and confirmation, he hath a priviledge that he cannot err, and the General Councils receives the ſame through his approbation and confirmation. But I anſwer: The Pope can give no greater prerogative to others, then he hath himſelf: But (as hath been proved before) the Popes may err, and have been hereticks: therefore they cannot give this prerogative to others And if ye will ſay (as ſome of you do) that the Pope, ſuppoſe he may err privatly, as he is a privat man, and as a privat teacher, yet he cannot err as he is Pope in his office judicially. Whereunto I anſwer, firſt, That ſome of your own Church, as <hi>Gerſon</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, de poteſtate Eccleſiae, Alphonſus de Caſtro lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>contra haereſ. Canus, loci Theolog. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſixth, all theſe teaches. <hi>That the Popes may err and teach hereſie, as they are Popes.</hi> Either therefore the Popes may err, as they are Popes judicially, and teach hereſie, or elſe not only theſe Doctors of your own Church, but alſo the Pope himſelf hath erred, and that in a point of doctrine: and ſo however it be, the Popes as they are Popes, judicially may err in points of doctrine. Secondly, I ſay, beſides nine Popes which have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and that when they were Popes, ſundrie of them have made decrees, not only contrary to Gods Word, but alſo contrary one to another, and that in matters of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. As for example. Pope <hi>Celeſtin</hi> the third, made a decree, <hi>cap. laudabilem de converſione infidelium, that when of married perſons the one falls in hereſie, the marriage is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the Catholick partie is free to marry again;</hi> contrary to the truth of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. <hi>and</hi> 19.9. and alſo contrary to the decreet of Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, <hi>lib</hi> 4. <hi>decretal. cap.

That the mistery of the body and blood in the Sacrament cannot be divided, and that the Sacrament cannot be taken in one kind only without great ſacriledge:</hi> and yet the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath decreed the contrary, and the whole Romane Church practiſes the contrary.

Quoniam.</hi> Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> ſaith, <hi>Diſt.</hi> 40. <hi>cap. A quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Judaeo,</hi> that that Baptiſm which is miniſtred without expreſs mention of the three perſons of the Trinity, is firm and ſure enough. But Pope <hi>Zacharie, Diſt. eadem de conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat. cap. In Synodo,</hi> hath decreed the contrary. All theſe decreets are ſet down in their Canon Law, and hath the ſtrength of a law in the Roman Church, not as privat mens, but as Popes decreets. And yet ſome of them are directly repugnant to the Word of God, that themſelves cannot deny but they are hereſies, and ſome of them ſo directly repugnant to the decreets of other Popes, that either the one or the other muſt be hereſie.</p>
                  <p>But it may be ye will anſwer, that ſuppoſe the Pope may err as he is Pope, and that in matters of doctrine, yet he cannot err with his Council, either Provincial or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith. Whereunto I anſwer, firſt, if Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils lawfully conveaned together, may err in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of doctrine, unleſs they be confirmed by the Pope, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> grants; and if the Popes may err themſelves alone, and that judicially in matters of doctrine, as hath
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106559:53"/> been proved: why may they not err alſo being joyned together, ſeeing Councils have this priviledge only by his confirmation and allowance? As <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Rom. Pontif. cap.</hi> 3. Secondly, I ſay, either Pope <hi>Steven</hi> the 6. with his Council erred in condemning of <hi>Formoſus</hi> and his acts which he made as Pope, and in decreeing his ordinations to be void and null, becauſe the man was wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by whom they were ordained, <hi>Sigebert in Chron.</hi> which is an error of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> or elſe Pope <hi>John</hi> the 9. with his Council of 72. Biſhops, erred, in juſtifying <hi>Formoſus</hi> and his decreets, and condemning the acts of Pope <hi>Steven</hi> with his Council. Laſt of all, ſince General Councils that have been confirmed by their Popes have erred, the ſixth General Council confirmed by Pope <hi>Hadrian, in epist. ad Thracium quae est in</hi> 2. <hi>actione,</hi> 7. <hi>Syn. Canon.</hi> 2. hath ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry errors which they themſelves will not defend, as the <hi>rebaptizing of hereticks.</hi> For the counſel of <hi>Cyprian</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed there, wherein this is decreeted. And alſo it <hi>is ordained Canon</hi> 13. <hi>that Elders, Deacons, Subdeacons, ſhould not ſeparat from their wives, contrary to the Canon of the Roman Church,</hi> as is ſaid there. And <hi>the marriage of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks and Hereticks is judged null and voyd, Canon</hi> 67. which your ſelf cannot deny to be an error contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs truth of God, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.13. And the forbidding of Miniſters to remain with their wives, <hi>Canon</hi> 12. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſixth Canon of the Apoſtles. Either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a General Council confirmed by a Pope hath erred, or elſe the Apoſtles have erred in this Canon, for they judge them to be the Canons of the Apoſtles. The firſt General Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which are both by their own confeſſion approved by the Popes, <hi>Bellarm lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Concilijs, cap.</hi> 5. And yet both theſe have decreeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſhould have equal priviledges of authority,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106559:54"/> honor and dignity in Eccleſiaſtical affaires with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> except only the firſt place or ſeat, the which by their own confeſſion is an error. Therefore either law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful General Councils confirmed by the Pope, have erred, or elſe the Pope is not the head of the Church, and hath not a preeminence of authority over the reſt, for they have made the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> equal with him; or elſe there are two heads of thier Church, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> I omit the reſt. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>de baptiſmo contra Donatiſtas, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>That Provincial Councils may be corrected by General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and of General Councils, the former may be amended by the latter;</hi> If they may be mended, then they may err. And here he ſpeaks not of a matter of fact, but of a matter of faith: For he ſpeaks of the baptiſm of hereticks. Now to conclud, ſeeing the Churches in all ages, before the Law, in the time of the Law and in the time of grace yea and the Apoſtles, and <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf have erred: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that claims this priviledge of not erring above all other Churches, hath erred alſo, and that not only her people which they call <hi>Laicks,</hi> but alſo her Clergy, ſeverally, and together in Councils, as well Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial as General. And ſeeing the head, which (as they ſay) is the Rock and foundation of the Church, hath erred in life, in Office, in matters of Faith and Religion, not as privat men only, but as Popes, both by themſelves alone, as alſo with their Councils, as well Provincial as General. Seeing, I hope, I have proved all theſe things ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then may I not with the judgement of all men ſafely conclud, that that main pillar whereupon the whole weight and pillar of your Religion depends <hi>(that the Church cannot err)</hi> that it is an error, and ſuch a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and damnable error, whereupon all the errors of your Religion is built, that whoſoever will believe it, they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106559:54"/> hazard the endleſs ſalvation of their ſouls. Ground then (Chriſtian Reader) thy ſalvation not upon this, <hi>that the Church cannot err;</hi> for that is falſe: but upon this that as long as ſhe ſticks to the Word of God written in the Old and New Teſtament, ſhe errs not; and when ſhe ſwerves and it were but an inch broad from the Scripture, then ſhe errs. And therefore two learned Papiſts, <hi>Gerſon. de exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat. part.</hi> 1. <hi>conſid.</hi> 5. and <hi>Panorm.</hi> affirms: the one ſaith, <hi>Simplici non authorizato, ſed excellenter in ſacris literis erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> &amp;c. that is, that more credit is to be given to one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and ſimple, but yet excellently beſeen in the holy Writ in a point of doctrine, then to the Pope. And ſuch a learned man ſaith, he ought to oppone himſelf to a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, if he perceive the greater part to decline to the contrary of the Goſpel, either of malice, or of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The other ſaith, <hi>extra de elect. cap. Significaſti, That more credit is to be given to an unlearned and ſimple man that brings for him the Scripture, then to a whole General Council.</hi> And this for anſwer to the teſtimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which ye cited.</p>
                  <p>Now, as concerning the Fathers teſtimonies which ye bring in, they will ſerve you no further then the Scripture hath done: For they will go no further with you, then this that the Church of Chriſt and his covenant with her ſhal endure for ever, the which we grant, and they that will read them will find them ſo. And if ye prove any further out of them, it ſhal be anſwered by Gods grace: For it were too faſhous to the Reader to ſet down here the particular ſayings of every one of them. And if ye had formed your arguments out of them, I ſhould have formed my anſwer, by the grace of God, to every one of them. And thus much concerning your ground, and the proofs of it. Now I come to that which ye gather of it.</p>

               <p>Then ſeeing that there was none of his profeſſion in the earth before him immediatly, neither viſible nor inviſible, he and his could not be the Church of Chriſt: for it hath ever ſtood, and never failed, no not the ſpace of one day univerſally, becauſe our Savior ſaith, I ſhal be with you every day to the conſummation of the world.</p>

                  <p>As to your collection, the form of it muſt be this. That Church only muſt be the true Church that hath never been interrupted, nor failed in any ſubſtantial head of faith and Religion ſince Chriſt and his Apoſtles. But ſay ye, yours is ſuch, and ours not: Therefore your Church is the true Church, and ours not. The propoſition I grant. But all the controverſie lyes in the probation of your aſſumption. Yea, in ſtead of proving, ye ſay it is not poſſible to me, nor to no Miniſter in <hi>Scotland</hi> to aſſign to you the circumſtances of all mutations and changes in your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as the perſon, time, place, &amp;c. And then ye attempt to aſſign all theſe circumſtances of our Religion, upon the which ye conclud the falſehood of it. So we will firſt ſee how ye prove your own, and then ſee how ye diſprove ours. Indeed this argument of yours is of ſuch account with you, that there are not many of your Writers, but they have ſet it, as it were, in the vant-guard of their hoſt, and among the greateſt of their ſtrengths and bulwarks, for to uphold their ruinous <hi>Babel.</hi> So <hi>Hammilton</hi> and <hi>Hay,</hi> in their demands to the Miniſters of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſo <hi>Campion,</hi> ſo <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus Scotus</hi> againſt <hi>Whitaker</hi> in his defence, ſo your Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts <hi>upon the</hi> 28. <hi>of the Acts, and on</hi> 1. <hi>John</hi> 2. and ſo <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Eccleſ. cap.</hi> 5. Whereby it may be ſeen of what account this argument of yours is in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your Church.</p>
                  <p>But to anſwer to your argument: firſt, I ſay, If there be no mutations or changes in your Religion ſince Chriſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106559:56"/> and his Apoſtles, then your Religion and doctrine will be one with that which is ſet down in the Scripture of God. For you will not deny, I hope, but the Scripture doth ſufficiently teſtifie, what doctrine and Religion was in Chriſts and his Apoſtles dayes. And ſo let it once be put in the ballance of the Scripture, and tryed thereby, and then I hope it will ſoon be made manifeſt how far it is changed. So, and you dare, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> let once your Religion be ſet upon the pannel, and let it once have an aſſiſe of the Scripture, and then the plea will end, I hope.</p>
                  <p>Next, I ſay, it will not follow, We cannot aſſign all the circumſtances of changes in your Religion: Therefore your Religion is uncorrupted. For it ſuffiſeth if we can prove the firſt only, that is, the matter or doctrine it ſelf which is changed, and that by comparing it with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, ſuppoſe we could not aſſign all the reſt of the circumſtances of the mutation, as the time, place, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, &amp;c. for the changes of many things are moſt noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and yet all the circumſtances of the change thereof not known. We ſay then, it is not needful to ſeek the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings and circumſtances of the decays and corruptions in your Church, when the corruption and change it ſelf is ſo manifeſt, by comparing your doctrine with the written Word of God, that it cannot be denyed. For will you ſay, that he who is deadly diſeaſed, is whole and ſound, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I cannot tell you the firſt article of time, the place, and firſt occaſion of the diſeaſe? When it is manifeſt that a city is full of miſorder and confuſion, will ye ſay that ye will not believe it to be ſo, unleſs you know the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings and progreſs of theſe miſorders? If you ſaw a rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous houſe, would ye ſay, Prove me and tell me all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the change of it, otherwiſe I will not believe it? Will ye deny that a ſhip could be drowned, unleſs it were told you all the circumſtances of the change of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106559:56"/> leck where through it drowned? If any found a man fallen in a pit, ſhal he not believe that he is fallen whom never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he ſees to be there, unleſs it were told him, when and by whom he was caſt into the ſame? Even ſo will ye not believe, or will ye hinder all others to believe, that your Church and Religion is ruinous conſumed, rotten, dead, drowned, and full of miſorder, hereſie, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, unleſs the firſt beginnings of theſe changes can be told you? We ſay therefore it is ſufficient to prove the ruine and conſumption of your Church and Religion, if by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring your doctrine with the truth of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we make evident the direct oppoſition betwixt them, ſuppoſe we could not aſſign all the circumſtances of the change of it out of the hiſtories, leaving it free to Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers to write what they pleaſe, and omit what they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is manifeſt, that the Church of the Jewes in the time of Chriſt was changed both in doctrine and manners from that eſtat that it was in the time of <hi>Aaron, Eleazar,</hi> and ſundry others: and alſo the Churches of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> that they were changed from the eſtat wherein they were. And yet I ſuppoſe that neither ye, nor any Papiſt in the earth, is able to aſſign to me all the circumſtances of the mutations and changes in the ſame, as the firſt authors, time, place, &amp;c. and yet there was a great change in doctrine and Religion in all theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as hath been proved before. And we read that our Savior and the Apoſtles, convicted them of a change, and yet they deſigned not the firſt authors, time, and place, &amp;c. The like I ſay of the Church of <hi>Greece, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> which in number exceeds yours. That there is a wonderful change in their Church and Religion, ye will not deny, or elſe your Religion is hereſie: For (as ſaid is) they acknowledge not your Popes ſupremacy,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106559:57"/> tranſubſtantiation, &amp;c. And yet I ſuppoſe, ye nor no Papiſt in the earth, is able to aſſign all the circumſtances of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in their Church and Religion which they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently: yea, more unable to do this, then we are able to do the ſame in yours. I mean not the hereſies of <hi>Arrius, Samoſatenus, Neſtorius, Eutyches, Sergius,</hi> and the reſt, which long ago were damned by the Councils of the Greek Churches. (For I ſuppoſe ye ſhal not be able to prove that they now maintain theſe hereſies which they condemned and refuted long ago.) But I mean of the preſent errors and corruptions in their worſhip and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which now they maintain and profeſs. If then ye judge the Churches of the Eaſt heretical, becauſe they are not agreeable to your doctrine and Religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet not be able to aſſign the circumſtances of the changes and mutations of the ſame, will ye not grant the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to us, to account and judge your Church and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion failed, becauſe it is not agreeable to the doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, ſet down in the Scripture, ſuppoſe we could not aſſign to you the circumſtances of the changes of the ſame?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I ſay, if you have read <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> there ye ſhal find many hereſies, which I omit for ſhortneſs, which he accounts hereſies, whoſe beginnings and authors are unknown.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, there is ſuch an univerſal complaint of the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous abominations &amp; decays in your Religion, diſcipline, and manners, and that by your own Councils, <hi>Concil. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. ſeſſ.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Trident. ſeſſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Baſil. ſeſſ.</hi> 2. 3. Fathers, <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard. in Cant.</hi> 33. Popes, Cardinals, and Friers, that I would have thought it uncredible, unleſs I had read them, that either your own mouthes ſhould have ſo condemned your ſelves, or elſe that the poſterity afterward ſhould have been ſo ſhameleſs as to have boaſted of the purity of their
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106559:57"/> Church and Religion. Therefore the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath proclaimed it to the world in writ, that the Church hath need to be reformed in the head and members. Now, I ask that of you concerning theſe abuſes in diſcipline and manners, which ye ask of us concerning your doctrine. Show me all the circumſtances of mutation and change diſtinctly, if ye can, what time, what place, by what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, &amp;c. ſuch monſtrous abominations firſt brake in in your Church and Religion? Now ſeeing there is no man who hath a ſpark of judgement, that will doubt of that incredible change of manners and diſcipline in your Church, and yet the circumſtances of the changes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known: think ye then that ye ſhal aſſure men that no chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges could fall in your doctrine, unleſs we knew the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the changes of the ſame?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, the Scripture teſtifies, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.27.28 that even the tares which is the evil ſeed, doth not appear ſo ſoon as they are ſown; and that neither the times, nor the firſt author of them was known, no not to the moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent laborers of the Lords ground at the firſt: and yet it was enough to know them to be evil ſeed, by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that was ſeen betwixt them and the good ſeed, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the time, place and author was unknown at the firſt. So it is proof enough againſt your doctrine, that it is but tares, if the difference be made manifeſt between it and the Lords truth in the Scripture, ſuppoſe the circumſtances of the changes of it cannot be aſſigned.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, error is likened to <hi>leaven and a canker,</hi> which doth not all at once infect the whole maſs, and feſter the whole body, but piece and piece: ſo your corruption came not in all at once, but piece and piece infected your Church, and feſtered your Religion. And therefore it is no wonder ſuppoſe the beginnings of infection and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of it hath not been marked: For if they had
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106559:58"/> broken in all at once, and ſuddenly overthrown the whole Church, it had been no difficulty to have aſſigned the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the overthrow of it. For if any having a whole conſtitution with a ſtroke were ſlain, if a ſhip with a wave were drowned, it were no difficulty to aſſign the circumſtances of the ſudden changes. But in a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in a leck that hath come in piece and piece in the body and in the ſhip, the beginnings thereof cannot be ſo eaſily perceived: For a little leck in proceſs of time will ſink a great ſhip. And if it be ſo hard to diſcern the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of theſe things which our ſenſes may grope, how much more hard is it to perceive the beginnings of theſe ſpiritual corruptions which cannot be perceived by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man, but only by the light of Gods Spirit by the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual man?</p>
                  <p>Eightly, if now it be ſo in other hereſies, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teſtifies of them, that their beginnings are ofttimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, even unto the moſt diligent laborers of the Lords husbandrie, and that they come in by little and little and doth not infect all at once, how much more is this true in your Antichriſtian Religion, which (as it was fore-told) ſhould deceive all Nations, and make them <hi>drunken with the wine of her fornication?</hi> And therefore your doctrine is termed in the Scripture, an <hi>iniquitie,</hi> but a <hi>ſecret iniquitie:</hi> an <hi>unrighteouſneſs,</hi> but yet a <hi>deceivable unrighteouſneſs:</hi> a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion,</hi> but yet <hi>a ſtrong deluſion,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> an <hi>abomination and ſpiritual fornication, Rev.</hi> 17. but yet put in <hi>a golden cup;</hi> that is, having the ſhow of godlineſs and Religion; and your Church is called, <hi>a harlot,</hi> but yet finely <hi>decked in purple,</hi> &amp;c. not like a harlot, but <hi>a Queen.</hi> Your Kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is called, <hi>a beaſt that ſpeaks like the dragon,</hi> but yet like <hi>the lamb in his horns,</hi> reſembling the power and authority of the Lord Jeſus. Seeing then your Church, Kingdom and Doctrine, is ſuch a myſtery of iniquity; hath ſuch a ſhow of godlineſs, hath
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106559:58"/> ſuch a reſemblance with the lamb, hath ſuch clokes of ſtyles, is ſo deceivable, and is ſuch a ſtrong deluſion, as the Scripture teſtifies of it: Is it any wonder, ſuppoſe the beginnings of this myſtery, and of the whoredoms of this Queen, be not diſtinctly marked and ſet down?</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, it is likely enough that the great credit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the firſt Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> was for their piety and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the lofty eſtat of their ſucceſſors after them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their cruelty and tyranny, did ſo dazel on the one ſide the eyes of the godly, that they were not inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in marking the changes and beginnings of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and ſo bridled the mouthes of other ſome, that they durſt not write the things they ſaw; and if they writ any thing, they writ it but barely and corruptly; for the tyranny of your Church was ſuch, that none durſt mutter againſt your Church and Religion, but he was taken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further as an heretick, and condemned and executed where ever your tyranny reached.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, ſuppoſe they had been written by the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of every age, and that diſtinctly; yet conſidering the univerſal power, craft and policy of your Church and Kingdom, is it any wonder ſuppoſe they be not now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant at all, but either burnt, or elſe ſo falſified and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the beginnings thereof ſhould not have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? For ſeeing in the purer times, when the power and dominion of your Church was not yet come to the hight, ſuch was the ambition and falſhood of your Popes, that in the preſence of a Council of 217. Biſhops in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, anno</hi> 430. where <hi>Augustin</hi> was preſent, they did alledge a falſe Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> for to have eſtabliſhed their ſupremacy, and under one of their hands ſent it to the Council by their Legats; the which was eſpyed and found out by the whole Council, that not only it was decreed and ordained in that Council he ſhould
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106559:59"/> have no prerogative over the Churches of <hi>Africk,</hi> and that none ſhould appeal to him under the pain of depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and excommunication: but al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o he was rebuked by the Fathers of that Council in their letters to him. If he was ſo bold then, what marvel ſuppoſe ſince he hath falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and corrupted every Hiſtory and Writing that he ſaw might bear any wayes witneſs of the corruptions, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and abominations of that Church and Religion of his? And hence it is, I am ſure, that we find ſo little writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the beginnings of their corruptions, and of them that reſiſted it. And your <hi>Index expurgatorius,</hi> deviſed in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> for blotting out every thing in the writings of men that might teſtifie of your corruptions, doth alſo ſufficiently witneſs unto the world what ye did in the former times. So, to conclud this, ſuppoſe we could not aſſign to you the circumſtances of the changes of your Religion, yet it follows not but your Religion and Church may be corrupted and decayed.</p>
                  <p>But to ſatisfie your demand (ſuppoſe I hope the things already ſaid, will ſatisfie the conſciences of the godly) What crave you, that all the circumſtances of changes in your Religion may be aſſigned to you? Firſt then, I ſay, there is nothing that may ſerve either <hi>to make the man of God w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe unto ſalvation, or yet that may make him perfect in every good work,</hi> but the Scripture teſtifies: For it is able to do both theſe. If theſe circumſtances then ſerve either for ſalvation or perfection, I ſay they are ſet down in the Scripture, ſo that we need not to go to Hiſtories to ſearch the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The firſt then ye crave, is the time when the change be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. The Scripture tells you, <hi>That the myſtery of iniquity began to work even then in the Apoſtles days, and that it doth already work,</hi> and ſo grew on from degree to degree, till <hi>he that withheld it was removed;</hi> that is, till the Empire of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106559:59"/> 
                     <hi>Rome</hi> began to decay, and the ſeat of it removed from thence, as the Fathers expounded it, <hi>Auguſtin, Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, Jerome,</hi> and ſo the city left to the Pope, the man of ſin, for him to ſet his throne there: for <hi>Rome</hi> that <hi>ſeven hilled City, Rev.</hi> 17 9 behoved to be the ſeat of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, as it was fore told by the Scripture. So, if you will believe the Scripture, you have the time.</p>
                  <p>What crave you next? The place? I ſay the Scripture teſtifieth of the ſame, that that <hi>mystical Babylon,</hi> which <hi>Bellarmin lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Rom. Pontif. cap</hi> 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. your chief champion, grants to be <hi>Rome, that ſits upon ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ven hills, that had the dominion over the Kings of the earth;</hi> that is the place where firſt your Church and Religion began to decay. So there the place, if you will believe the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>What crave you next? The author? The Scripture alſo hath fore told, <hi>That the beast that came out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit, and ſlew the witneſſes of God, and made war with the Saints, and overcame them, and made all to worſhip the image of the beaſt and the harlot Babel</hi> (the city of Rome) <hi>the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of whoredoms, who made all Nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, Rev.</hi> 12 7. <hi>and</hi> 14.8. That is your head and Church, they are the authors and mothers of this decay and corruption.</p>
                  <p>What is the fourth thing ye require? The Church that ſaid againſt the ſame? The Scripture will tell you that too: <hi>The two witneſſes of God whom ſhe killed, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that fled in the wilderneſs, the Saints with whom ſhe made war, and who would not worſhip the beaſt, nor receive his image; the hundred forty and four thouſand that John ſaw ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the Lamb on mount Sion, who was not defiled with your idolatry, but followed the Lamb whith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rſoever he went, Rev.</hi> 11. <hi>and</hi> 12 <hi>and</hi> 13. <hi>and</hi> 14. Theſe then are the true Church which ſpake againſt your corruptions, who are like unto <hi>Eliahs</hi> ſeven thouſand that had not bowed their knees to <hi>Baal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:106559:60"/>
                  <p>What crave you more? The matter it ſelf they ſaid againſt? The Scripture, and ye will believe, will ſatisfie you in this point alſo. The doctrine then that was ſaid againſt, <hi>Was the myſtery of iniquity, that deceivableneſs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, that ſtrong deluſion,</hi> 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2 <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. <hi>That doctrine of the dragon, that ſpiritual idolatrie and abomination, Rev.</hi> 17.18. <hi>That doctrine of Devils, in forbidding marriage, and commanding abstinence of meat, &amp;c.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>What crave you laſt? The number from whom they departed? The Scripture will alſo bear witneſs of this, ſeeing your Religion is a departure from the faith, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. then all theſe that ever profeſſed the faith of Jeſus ſet down in his written Word, even the Lord Jeſus the head, the Apoſtles, the layers of the foundation, the primitive Churh, the woman that fled in the wilderneſs, the Saints with whom ye made war, and all the elect and choſen of God that abhorred your idolatrie. Theſe are the true Churches from whom you departed.</p>
                  <p>What now crave you more? Will not the abundance of the rivers of the Scriptures of God quench and ſatisfie this your deſire, but that you muſt go unto the unpure fountains of mens writings, as though the Scriptures were not ſufficient, not only to make a man wiſe unto ſalvation, but to make him perfect in every thing? Theſe things, I am ſure, will ſatisfie the ſouls of them that love the truth. But becauſe you give no credit to the Scriptures, but counts them as <hi>a noſe of wax;</hi> and as one of your Popes, ſpeaking to <hi>Bembus</hi> a Cardinal, called them <hi>a fable of Chriſt,</hi> and yet ſuch a fable as hath inriched your treaſures And <hi>Sylveſter Prierias</hi> writing againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> ſaith, That the <hi>Roman Church and Pope is of greater authority then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> O horrible blaſphemies of the holy truth of God. Therefore we will go to the Hiſtories, and ſee what they have teſtified of theſe circumſtances. And although all
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106559:60"/> things here be not expreſſed to the full, yet there is ſo much left uncorrupted and unſcraped out (by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious providence of God, that would not want his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all ages) out of the Fathers, and your own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that I hope will ſatisfie the conſciences of all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and godly. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ſtrom. that the Apostles ſucceſſors received the doctrine from them, as the ſons from their fathers.</hi> But he ſubjoyns, <hi>That there was very few children that was like their fathers.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106559:61"/> of your mouth, and ſaying, That your Church had the truth in all things, and never failed nor was interrupted, againſt ſuch a cloud of witneſſes, whoſe teſtimonies ye dare not refuſe. But I leave you to the Lord. <hi>The lips of a liar is abomination to the Lord, Prov.</hi> 20 So your own mouthes ſhal riſe up in the day of the Lord and condemn you that ſaith, Your Church hath not failed in any ſubſtantial point of Religion. But you require more diſtinctly the time, place, and perſons, &amp;c. that hath brought in this mutation and change. If theſe are to be accounted authors of your erroneous doctrines who were the chief defenders there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; then I ſay, the Popes of Rome (for the moſt part) are the authors of the ſame; for they were the chief defenders thereof, ſuppoſe they had not been the firſt teachers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For otherwiſe <hi>Luther</hi> cannot be ſaid to be the author of our Religion, as ye ſay, becauſe he was not the firſt that taught the ſame, and that by your own confeſſion. For ye ſay, that ſundry other hereticks before <hi>Luther</hi> taught the ſame heads of doctrine which he taught, and which we profeſs now: as that faſting ſhould be free, that only faith juſtifieth, that man hath not free will, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Next, becauſe it were too longſome to go through the whole heads of your Religion, therefore I will only bring a few examples, and that in ſome of the ſubſtantial points thereof. As for the ſacrifice of the Maſs, and the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies thereof. I have ſhown the authors thereof in another place, therefore I omit that now.</p>
                  <p>The firſt that ever took upon him to exerciſe juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over the Churches of the Eaſt, was Pope <hi>Victor anno</hi> 200. or 198. who took upon him to excommunicat the Biſhops of the Eaſt, becauſe they would not follow his faſhion in the celebration of Eaſter. There the perſon, time, and place, reſiſted by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Biſhop of Lions in France, and the Biſhops of the Eaſt, and the brethren
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106559:62"/> there, <hi>Polycarpus</hi> and ſundrie others, <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 25.26.</p>
                  <p>The firſt that took upon him the ſtyle to be called Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Biſhop, was the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople, anno</hi> 581. reſiſted by <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and after him by <hi>Gregorius</hi> Biſhops of Rome, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>epiſtola</hi> 32.38 39.

                  <p>The firſt that appointed laws of faſting, was <hi>Montanus</hi> the heretick, <hi>anno</hi> 145. <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. accounted he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie by <hi>Apolonius</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> againſt the faſting of the <hi>Manicheans.</hi> The <hi>Manicheans</hi> were the firſt we read of that miniſtred the Communion under one kind, as the Papiſts do now: ſo forth of many other old condemned hereſies which your Church hath renewed, as ſhal be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved afterward.</p>
                  <p>The firſt that gave the riſe to Tranſubſtantiation, was <hi>Mark</hi> a notable Magician <hi>anno</hi> 115. who by his inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having firſt cauſed a cup of white wine to bear the color of blood, made his followers believe that by his invocation over it, that grace which is above all things, had powred his blood into the cup, refuted by <hi>Epiphanius, Haereſ.</hi> 34. and <hi>Irenaeus lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>The firſt that decreed Tranſubſtantiation in effect, was Pope <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the 2. <hi>anno</hi> 1090. in cauſing <hi>Berengarius</hi> to recant, <hi>De conſecrat. Diſtinct.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.

The firſt that decreed the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106559:62"/> of Images, was <hi>Hadrian</hi> in the 2. Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> againſt the expreſs Scripture, after the example of <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi> an heretick, who worſhipped the Image of Jeſus, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by ſundry Fathers, and Councils, <hi>Concil.

Propoſuiſti.</hi> as the <hi>Manichees</hi> did before him, reſiſted by ſundrie, <hi>Sigebert. &amp; H. Mutius.</hi> Let theſe examples ſerve as a taſte to the reader.</p>
                  <p>How ſtronglie now ye have manned and fortified your own Church and Religion by your proofs, let the reader judge. Now let us ſee, how ye diſprove ours. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion now comes in of the truth of our Church and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whither it be from Jeſus Chriſt, or not? You ſay, it is not from him, but from others ſince his time. If ye had gone the ſtraight way to have proved this, and to have ſatisfied the conſciences of men, you would at the neareſt have run to the Scripture, and by the ſame have diſproved it. But you in ſtead of this go a far by-way, and would father our Religion on fleſh and blood, duſt and aſhes, in pointing us out <hi>Martin Luther</hi> to be the father and author of the ſame, as though it had not an ancienter pedegre to reckon unto, nor had not the beginning and foundation of it from the root of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> the bud of the Lord, from whom it hath ſprung. And for to get your ſelf the better credit, you buſie your ſelf in marking the circumſtances of his preaching, as time, place, matter, oppoſition, &amp;c. Now that ye are ſo skilled and acquainted with that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> that you can aſſign all theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, it is no wonder, for that was the moſt notable and remarkable period of the decaying of your <hi>Babel,</hi> and of the erecting up again of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, which your head and Clergy had ſtamped under foot for
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106559:63"/> ſo many years; which ſuppoſe the beginning of it was but like <hi>a little leaven, and as a grain of muſtard ſeed which of all ſeeds is the leaſt,</hi> yet now ſince it hath ſo ſowred almoſt the whole maſs, even the moſt part of the Kingdoms of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, which once was under your ſpiritual bondage, and hath grown up into ſuch a high tree having fair and great branches, under the which the Lords ſheep may get reſt and warmneſs, and in the which his ſouls that mounts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to that Kingdom, doth build their neſts, ſo that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can all your purgations, nor yet all your axes of fire and ſword, of buls and pardons, of preachings and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, ſtay the ſpreading of the one, nor cut down the branches and root of the other. That <hi>M. Luther</hi> began at that time, and in that place, and preached againſt theſe doctrines, we do not deny, and that is not controverted: But here lyes all the queſtion, whither if that doctrine that he preached againſt, was Antichriſtian or not? and whither that Religion which he neither invented, nor yet firſt preached (for ſundry before him did preach that ſame doctrine, whoſe names I ſet down in my anſwer to your objection) but only raiſed it out of the grave of darkneſs wherein ye had buried the truth of God? Here then, I ſay, is the queſtion whither that Religion which he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched hath the warrant from Jeſus Chriſt in his Teſtament, or not? The which if ye ever diſprove by the written Word of God, then ſhal we grant you all that ye ſay, the which is as impoſſible to you to do, no not ſuppoſe your King would call all your wiſe men and Clergy together, as it was to all the wiſe men of <hi>Babel,</hi> to tell and interpret <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> his dream: yea ſuppoſe your King would reward you gloriouſly with honor and riches if ye could do it, yet are ye not able to win your wages: yea, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he would tear you in pieces, and make your houſe a jakes, unleſs ye did it, as the wiſe men of <hi>Babel</hi> was,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106559:63"/> becauſe they could not tell and interpret the Kings dream. This is therefore the point which lyes in queſtion betwixt us, which ye ſhould have proved, if ye could. But know ye for a truth; that ſuppoſe he raiſed out of the grave the truth of God which ye had buried, yet was he neither the inventer, nor the firſt preacher of it: but it hath for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and Author of it, Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, and the foundation of it in the New Teſtament of his holy Scripture. This for the Author, time, and place which ye aſſign.</p>
                  <p>Now, to the Churches that ſpake againſt him. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, They were but ſuch as was made drunken with the wine of your fornication, and deluded by your ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, being deceived by the golden cup, wherein you propined them to be drunken out, as it was propheſied of you, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.4. But the meaſure of your iniquity being full, and the time of the lurking of the truth of God being run out. God of his infinit mercy by his miniſtery, and the reſt that followed ſince, hath opened the eyes of a great part of theſe Kingdoms who firſt ſaid againſt him, to ſee your Church to be <hi>the whore, Rev.</hi> 17.1. your Kingdom to be <hi>the beast, Rev.</hi> 13.11. and your head to be <hi>the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> your doctrine to be <hi>deluſions,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.3.4.11. and your <hi>Rome</hi> to be that myſtical <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 18 4. And ſo the Lord hath made them believe, and give obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that commandment of his, <hi>Go out of her, my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> &amp;c. That ye call theſe the true Church that ſpake againſt him, that lyes in the weights and ballance yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us: For ere ye prove them to be the true Church, ye muſt firſt prove your doctrine which they then profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have the warrant out of the Word of God. So let them have the name of a Church, but of an impure and corrupted Church: of a Church infected by the peſt of your doctrine, oppreſſed by the tyranny of your Pope
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106559:64"/> and Clergy, and conſumed by the rotten humors of your Idolatry. So then, it was not the true Church, that is, the called ones by the light of the Goſpel (for they are the true Church that ſpake againſt him) but only theſe that were infected and poyſoned with your abominations, the which, I grant, did over-ſpread theſe Nations, as it was fore-told of her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.2. <hi>and</hi> 18.3. <hi>and</hi> 13.14.</p>
                  <p>And as for theſe firſt heads of Religion which he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned: <hi>Of your pardons, juſtification by works, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs,</hi> their condemnation is ſet down in the great Regiſter and Teſtament of Jeſus Chriſt the Lord of life, as ſhal be proved hereafter. So that he was not the firſt that oppugned them.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the laſt, the Churches from whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted: he departed not from their body, but from the conſumption of your hereſie that conſumed the body: Not from the Church, but from the corruptions of your Idolatry and abominations in the Church. Not from the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but from your tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Commonwealth. Not from the city of God, but from the peſt of your doctrine that infected the city. And laſt of all, not from the ſpiritual communion and ſociety of the Saints of God in theſe parts, but from the communion with <hi>Babel,</hi> with Antichriſt, with the beaſt, and with the dragon, and that at the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord, <hi>Flie from idolatry; Go out of Babel, my people.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3.4.5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. <hi>and</hi> 8.9. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.14. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.15.16.17.18. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4.</p>
                  <p>Now after you have aſſigned the mutations of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſince Chriſt and his Apoſtles (as you think) you gather the whole force of it together, and makes the ſtream of your argument to run as ſtrongly as it can upon our Church and Religion, that the face and form of it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106559:64"/> might be ſo waſhen away, that it be not known to be a true Church. Your reaſon then is this. The true Church of Chriſt hath never failed univerſally for the ſpace of one day, becauſe our Savior hath promiſed to be with it to the end of the world. But our Church was never before <hi>Martin Luthers</hi> dayes: therefore it is not the true Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>As to your propoſition, if ye take failing for erring in matters of doctrine, then I deny your propoſition; for I hope I have proved ſufficiently before, that the Church both may err and hath erred in all ages. But if you take failing to be utterly aboliſhed and rooted out of the face of the earth, then I grant your propoſition, that God hath ever a Church, the Church of his elect, with whom he will be to the end of the world. And as to your aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that our Church was never before <hi>Martin Luthers</hi> dayes, I deny it. Let us ſee how ye prove it. There was none (ſay ye) before his dayes, neither viſible nor inviſible that profeſſed his Religion. But how do ye prove that, for that is ſtill denied to you? For if your Religion hath the Old and New Teſtament to bear witneſs to it, and Jeſus Chriſt to be the author of it in every point, (as ſhal be made manifeſt by the grace of God) then I ſay whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were from the beginning of the world to this day, viſible or inviſible, that profeſſed the true Jeſus, the true Savior, his true doctrine and Sacraments wherein Religion ſtands, they are our predeceſſors, and are of our profeſſion and Religion: ſo then ye ſhould firſt (if ye had gone ſquarely to work) have diſproved the heads of our Religion, not to have their warrant from the tables of Chriſts Teſtament, ere ye had concluded that we had none of our profeſſion and Religion before <hi>Martin Luther.</hi> And this is the point you ſhould have begun at, for it is not the Church that makes the Religion, but the Religion that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106559:65"/> makes the Church. Have we a warrant out of the Word of God for our Religion, then are we the true Church, and the ſucceſſors of all them who ever from the beginning of the world have profeſſed the ſame. Have we not this warrant then, I grant you we have no true Church. So there is the point of our controverſie, whither our doctrine be from God, out of his Word, or not? But how prove ye that <hi>Martin Luther</hi> had none of his profeſſion before him?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, you gathered upon the former things that all the true Churches ſaid againſt him, and that he departed from them: unto the which I anſwered before, that theſe was not the true Church, but only ſo many of every Nation who was deceived by your doctrine, and whereof the Lord did cure a great many by his miniſtery, and by the miniſtery of others whom the Lord did ſtir up ſince, ſo that neither did the true Church who ſaw the truth, ſpeak againſt, nor yet did he depart from their ſocietie.</p>
                  <p>Next, as the Lord had a true Church in <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the time of <hi>Elias,</hi> even theſe who did not bow their knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 19 10.18. who was neither known to <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet, nor yet to the perſecuters: ſo did the Lord in the midſt of your darkneſs and Idolatry, reſerve to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a true Church, even theſe hundred forty and four thouſand which <hi>John</hi> ſaw ſtanding with the Lamb on mount Sion. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14 1. who did not defile themſelves with your Idolatry, and did not worſhip the beaſt, and receive his mark: which ſuppoſe neither ye nor we had known, yet the Lord did reſerve them as he promiſed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I ſay <hi>Martin Luther</hi> had ſundry who profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Religion immediatly before him, who was even known to the world, as I ſhal prove afterward.</p>
                  <p>Your next proof is taken from a teſtimony of one of our own Writers, where ye alledge that it is written of <hi>Martin
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106559:65"/> Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> that they were the firſt that came to the knowledge of the Goſpel. I ſay ye are not faithful in citing of this teſtimony for it ſaith not that they were the firſt that came to the knowledge of the Goſpel, but theſe are the words, <hi>That it was an eaſie thing to them</hi> (meaning of your Church) <hi>to deviſe againſt us</hi> (meaning the Engliſh Proteſtants, as ye call them) <hi>theſe curſed ſpeaches, when Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther and Zuinglius firſt came to the Goſpel.</hi> The Latin words are <hi>cum Martinus Luther &amp; Zuinglius primum acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſent ad Evangelium.</hi> So it ſaith not, that they were the firſt that came to the Goſpel, but that it was eaſie to you to ſpew out curſed ſpeaches when they came firſt to the Goſpel. So that this word <hi>primum,</hi> that is, firſt, is not in compariſon with them that knew the Goſpel before, but in compariſon with that time in the which they themſelves knew not the Goſpel. It is an adverb of time, and you take it for an adjective noun. But there is a vail over your eyes, that ye can neither ſee what we or your ſelves writes. So then to conclud, ſeeing the Religion which <hi>Martin Luther</hi> taught, hath the warrant from Chriſts Teſtament; and ſeeing all that ever profeſſed the true Religion that hath Chriſt to be the author of it in his Scripture, viſible or inviſible, are his predeceſſors: Therefore the Religion which <hi>Martin Luther</hi> taught was the true Religion. And ſeeing your Religion hath not Chriſt to be the author of it in his latter Teſtament, but is that apoſtaſie and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that Antichriſtian Kingdom that was fore-ſpoken of in the Scripture: Therefore I conclud, that your Church and Religion which he oppugned, is not the true Church and Religion, but that Antichriſtian Kingdom. And this for the firſt part of your objection. Now we come to the ſecond.</p>

                  <p>As for the other part of the objection which he alledges to be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106559:66"/> ours; that is, that our Religion was never ſaid againſt, we ſay not ſo: for why all hereticks, and others infected with falſe doctrine, have ever ſaid againſt the ſame, almoſt at all times. For how ſoon that Chriſt our Savior planted the truth, the Devil immediatly ſew popple in the ſame, according to the parable ſet down in S. Matthew.</p>

                  <p>I come now to that part which ye ſay is untruly alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of you, which moved you to ſay, that either I knew not your proofs, or if I knew them, that I altered the ſame that I might the better oppugn my own invention. Of my knowledge of your proofs, I will ſpeak nothing. But let us ſee whither this be my invention or not, or rather your own proof. You, for the confirmation of the truth of your Church and Religion, brought in this as a proof, that I, nor no Miniſter in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was able to aſſign the true Church that ſpake againſt it. Either then ye prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or elſe this muſt be one of your proofs, becauſe it was never ſpoken againſt by a true Church. Now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare theſe words with mine, and ſee whither I ſpeak igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly or untruly of your proofs. I ſaid, that ye affirmed your Religion to be true, becauſe it was never ſpoken againſt. Here our words are one, except this that ye add (be a true Church.) I underſtand the ſame; and therefore I gave the inſtances: firſt, of Chriſt and his Apoſtles: next, of the primitive Church: thirdly, of theſe that lived in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, which ſpake againſt your Religion: all which I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal your conſcience, whither think ye that I judge them a true Church or not? Now in that ye expound it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of hereticks, this is neither my words nor meaning, but your own invention.

John</hi> takes upon him an impoſſibility; for it is ſaid that it is impoſſible to prove a negative propoſition, except it be ſet down in the Word of God, which is of authority: and that I am ſure he cannot find, becauſe Papiſtry by him is not ſo old as the Word of God is. But in the mean time <hi>M. John</hi> proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. He offers very fair, and when ever he proves any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to us, with Gods grace he ſhal get an anſwer. And note here, that <hi>M. John</hi> can ſay nothing to our argument, for to it he gives no anſwer.</p>

                  <p>In your anſwer to this Section: Firſt, ye think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, becauſe of the form of it. Next, ye ſay it is but an offer, and I prove nothing. Thirdly, that I anſwer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to your argument, nor can anſwer nothing. Now of all theſe in order. And firſt to the form: ye think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to prove, becauſe it is a negative propoſition. Is not this a negative propoſition, that the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> are not the Antichriſt? You cannot deny it. Again, I ask is this ſentence to be found in the whole Scripture? I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ye will never be able to find it. Then, I ſay, if it be true that ye ſay, then ye your ſelf in your book, and this your anſwer, and <hi>Bellarmin lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Rom. Pont.</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derus</hi> 40. <hi>demonſtrations,</hi> and all the reſt of you that takes in hand to prove the Pope not to be the Antichriſt, takes
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106559:67"/> in hand, in your judgement, an impoſſibility (and ſo do you indeed; not becauſe it is a negative propoſition, but becauſe he is the Antichriſt in very truth.) What would the Pope your head think of you, if he heard you ſay ſo? Certainly, I think he would not inrol your name among the defenders of his Catholick faith, whereof this is the foundation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, is there not many formal ſyllogiſms that have the propoſition or aſſumption negatives; and will you ſay they cannot be proved if the matter be true, becauſe they are negatives? What is this but to raiſe the foundation of Logick and Raiſon? Logick is not Rhetorick, and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is not Logick: both theſe are negative propoſitions, and I ſuppoſe neither of them are ſo found in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and will you ſay that it is impoſſible to prove them, becauſe they are negatives? What you mean by this, I underſtand not, unleſs you do <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſtrive about words, prove and improve, forbidden by the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ye except theſe negative propoſitions which are ſet down in the Word of God, which hath authority, as ye ſay, I aſſume. But your Religion in ſubſtance is condemned in the Word of God: therefore by your own confeſſion, it may be proved, ſuppoſe it be negative. For <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de Theologia, That theſe ſentences that are collected out of the Scripture by a neceſſary conſequence, are of the ſame truth and authority with theſe ſentences that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſet down in the Scripture.</hi> And whereas ye ſay Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtrie by me is not ſo old as the Scripture, I grant that. What then? Therefore it is not condemned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I deny that. For Antichriſt and his Kingdom are not ſo old as the Scripture, and yet the Scripture condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it. For not only condemns it preſent hereſies, but alſo the hereſies that was to come. And ſeeing Papiſtrie
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106559:67"/> is that Antichriſtian Religion, as ſhal be made manifeſt, by Gods grace: therefore it hath the expreſs condemnation of it in the Word of God The form therefore of it, no wayes will make it impoſſible to be proved. As for the next thing that I prove nothing bu offers very fair. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it was not my purpoſe then, but I hope ye ſhal have a proof now of that which I offered then. As to the third then, that I can ſay nothing to your argument, which ye would h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve the Reader to mark. When I read this, I marked this that ye would earneſtly have the Reader per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the invincibleneſs of your argument, and my inability to anſwer. But what bring ye with you to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him of the ſame? Your reaſon is, becauſe I have not anſwered it. Will this follow, I have not (ſuppoſe it were ſo as ye ſay) therefore I cannot? It will not follow, I have not anſwered, I cannot anſwer to it. But as you have a new Theology, ſo have you a new Logick. But ſaid I nothing to your argument? What is not anſwered ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently in the ſame? Your argument was the antiquity of your Religion, and continuance of it from Chriſt by a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal ſucceſſion never interrupted, &amp;c. and the novelty of ours. My anſwer was: Yours was not inſtitut by Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles in his Scripture, as ours was; and yours was gain-ſaid in the chief points, by the teſtimonies of the Fathers the firſt ſix hundred years, and the principal points of our Religion confirmed by ſundry of their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, yours was that Antichriſtian apoſtaſie that the Scripture fore told ſhould come, and in the hight of your tyranny and Idolatry was gain-ſaid by many before <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther,</hi> and ours was profeſſed by ſundry before him, whoſe names I ſet down: all which I offered to prove, and now ſhal do, by Gods grace. Now you ſay this is no anſwer. But is that no anſwer that cuts the very throat
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106559:68"/> of your Religion (if it be verified) and invalidities your argument, that it do never ſtand up to under-prop your Religion again? For that Religion which is not inſtituted by Chriſt in the Scripture, whoſe main foundations is gain-ſaid by the teſtimonies of ſundry of the Fathers of the firſt 600. year, which is Antichriſtian, and which was gain-ſaid by the Saints that they perſecuted and ſlew, hath not the continuance from Chriſt by a lineal ſucceſſion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver interrupted, nor ſpoken againſt by a true Church till <hi>Martin Luthers</hi> days. This I am ſure ye will not deny. But your Religion is ſuch as I offered then to prove, and now have in ſome points, and ſhal in other ſome points by Gods grace. The which if it be verified, then I hope ye will not deny, but that your Religion hath neither anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, continuance, nor ſucceſſion from Chriſt till <hi>Martin Luthers</hi> dayes. And that Religion cannot be newly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and invented ſince <hi>Martin Luthers</hi> dayes, which hath the warrant and inſtitution of it in the Scripture, &amp;c. This you cannot deny. But our Religion is ſuch, as then I offered to prove, and now have done in ſome points, and ſhal do in other ſome points, by Gods grace. Therefore our Religion cannot be newly forged and invented, &amp;c. but is the only true Religion. So that this anſwer, if it be proved, doth ſufficiently vindicat our Religion from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty. Now if this be no anſwer to your argument, then I ſay no more, but ye will anſwer it the ſooner. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye formed your own argument your ſelf in your anſwer to me, and I have anſwered to it elſe, therefore I will now inſiſt no further upon it. And as for your lineal ſucceſſion of Biſhops, it will come in queſtion afterward, therefore I omit it now.</p>

                  <p>AS for the written Word, it is true that it is a moſt faithful witneſs (and it be not corrupted) to Chriſt and his Church, as our Savior teſtifies himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 5.39. of the which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion there is ſundry Proteſtants, chiefly young <hi>Merchiſton,</hi> in his diſcourſe upon the <hi>Revelation,</hi> in the 21. propoſition, and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>John</hi> 6.63. But that it ought to be Judge to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide all controverſies in Religion, <hi>M. John</hi> hath no Scripture for the ſame. It is the holy Ghoſt that muſt be Judge, and the holy Writ muſt bear witneſs thereto. For this cauſe the holy Ghoſt was given to the Church by the Father and the Son, that he might teach it all truth, <hi>John</hi> 14.25.26. This holy Ghoſt gives judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Paſtors of the true Church, as he did by the Apoſtles and Prieſts at the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It hath pleaſed the holy Ghoſt, and us (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.19.28.) and ſo he hath ever done ſince the beginning of the Church, when it was troubled with hereſies and falſe doctrine, as the Councils of <hi>Nice, Conſtantinople, Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>

                  <p>You firſt here decline the Scripture as Judge, to decide all controverſies in Religion. And you are not the firſt that have done this, but all your Roman Clergy with you. And ſuppoſe there were not another thing to make the conſciences of men ſuſpect your Religion that it is not found in the book of God, yet this is a great preſumption that ye give out of it your ſelves. For what may all men think of the ſame? but that if ye were perſwaded in your
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106559:69"/> conſcience to juſtify your Religion to be from Jeſus Chriſt in his written Word, ye would never decline the judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie of it: and the declining of the ſame, is an evident demonſtration that ye are privy to your ſelves in your own conſciences that it is not from God in his written Word. But wherefore ſay I that ye are privy to your ſelves of this? Ye have made it known to the world by your confeſſion in your own books, that many of the chief points of your Religion controverted between you and us, which ye maintain, have not their original beginning, nor authors in the Scriptures, but in your unwritten tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. So <hi>Petrus a Soto</hi> a Papiſt of great name confeſſed. He calls <hi>all theſe obſervations Apoſtolick traditions, whoſe beginning,</hi> principium, origo &amp; author, <hi>cannot be found in the whole Scriptures,</hi> in his book againſt <hi>Brentius.</hi> And then he reckons out a number of the chief and principal heads of their Religion, ſaying, <hi>Of the which ſort are the oblation of the ſacrifice of the altar, the invocation or prayers to Saints, the prayer for the dead, the ſupremacie of the Pope of Rome, the conſecration of the water in baptiſm, the whole ſacraments of orders, matrimonie, pennance, confirmation and extream un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the merits of works, the neceſſitie of ſatisfaction the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering over the ſins to the Prieſt. Caniſius</hi> a great Papiſt, <hi>in his Catechiſm, cap.</hi> 5. <hi>de praeceptis Eccleſiae</hi> ſaith, That <hi>the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of images, the ſet fastes, and the forty dayes of Lent, and all that are done in the ſacrifice of the Maſs, prayers and oblations for the dead, &amp;</hi> alia, <hi>and others,</hi> he ſaith, all theſe <hi>are traditions, becauſe they are ſuch that they cannot be defended by the Scripture.</hi> And <hi>Lindanus</hi> another great defender of your Romiſh faith and Religion, he reckons out for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, <hi>lib</hi> 4. <hi>Panopliae, cap.</hi> 100. <hi>&amp; in fine illius libri, tab.</hi> 6. that there <hi>are ſeven Sacraments, the conſecration of the water and oyl in Baptiſm; the real preſence of Chriſts fleſh and blood in the Sacrament, Communion under one kind, that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106559:69"/> the Lords Supper is a ſacrifice, that it ſhould be kept and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, privat Maſſes, Confeſſion of ſins to the Prieſts, ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, pardons, Purgatorie, and that Peter was in Rome. Martinus Pereſius</hi> another Papiſt, numbers <hi>the ſingle life of Prieſts,</hi> among the unwritten traditions. The truth is ſtrong, that hath ſo far glanced in the conſciences of ſome of you, and hath opened your mouthes to confeſs and to ſet it down in writ to the world, that the principal heads of your Religion, yea the very foundation and ground of it, (as the ſupremacie of your Popes, and the ſacrifice of your Maſs, and the reſt) are unwritten traditions which have not the beginning, nor original, nor authoritie in the Lords written Word; and which cannot be defended by the ſame, as ſome of your ſelves have confeſſed. So it is no wonder, ſuppoſe ye refuſe to have the controverſies of Religion decided by the ſame. Let the Reader now judge what he may think of your Religion, that hath not God in his Scripture in the principal and main foundations thereof (as ſome of your ſelves have confeſſed) to be the author and beginner thereof. So what needs any further proof againſt their Religion? Out of their own mouthes the falſhood of their Religion is convicted. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the true cauſe wherefore ye refuſed to have the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troverſies of Religion decided by the Scripture. And for this cauſe alſo hath your Church heaped up ſo many falſe calumnies, accuſations, and blaſphemies againſt the ſame, calling it <hi>obſcure,</hi>

So ye have been wiſe in your generation: <hi>Sed veritas tandem vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet:</hi> but the truth ſhal overcome at the laſt.</p>
                  <p>You grant it to be a witneſs, but yet you deal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly, while as ye put in an exception, <hi>if it be not corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> For if you be of that mind with your Church, and eſpecially with <hi>Canus lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>de locis Theologicis. Lindanus lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>de Optimo Genere interpret.</hi> and the Colledge of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> you think the Hebrew and Greek fountains of the Scripture to be corrupted. And therefore it is decreed in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> the old Latin vulgar tranſlation to be authentick, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by the confeſſion of ſome Papiſts, as <hi>Andradius, Pagnin,</hi> and <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> it hath miſſed the ſenſe and meaning of the holy Ghoſt ſometimes. So you not only put the Lord in his Scripture out of the bench, that he ſhould not judge and give out the ſentence of doom againſt your doctrine, but by this exception alſo ye remove him from the bar, that his teſtimony in the Hebrew and Greek fountains againſt you, ſhould have no credit. Let all men judge now what prejudice ye give againſt your own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when as ye will not admit the Lord in his Word in the Hebrew and Greek fountains, neither Judge nor witneſs.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:106559:70"/>
                  <p>But you ſay, I have no Scripture for me, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ought to be Judge. What will ye ſay then to Jeſus Chriſt in <hi>John</hi> 12.48. ſpeaking to ſuch as ye are, <hi>He that refuſeth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have ſpoken, it ſhal judge him in the laſt day.</hi> Unleſs now ye be a man of perdition, ye muſt confeſs that the Word of Jeſus Chriſt, (whereof ſo much is written as may make a man believe, and by believing to get eternal life) is <hi>Judge and judgeth preſently, and ſhal judge alſo in the latter day.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That God ſhal judge the ſecrets of mens hearts by Jeſus Chriſt, according to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</hi> So the Goſpel ſhal be the rule of that great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that great day, and ſo is it the rule of his worſhip while we are in the way to that judgement. Suppoſe you now decline the judicatorie of the ſame here, becauſe in your conſcience ye know, and your own mouthes have confeſſed it, that ye are not able to juſtifie your Religion thereby, yet nill ye will ye, ye ſhal be judged by the ſame Word in the laſt day. But whom will ye have to be your Judge? Ye ſay, the holy Ghoſt. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith, that we and your Church agrees in that, <hi>that the holy Ghoſt ſhould be ſupream Judge of all controverſies, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de verbi interpret, cap.</hi> 3. But is not the Scripture the holy Ghoſts own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible voice and breath? So then when the Scripture is Judge, the holy Ghoſt is Judge, becauſe the Scripture is the immediat voice of the holy Ghoſt; and the holy Ghoſt hath given out, and gives out his judgement in all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of Religion, in, and by the Scripture: and the holy Ghoſt illuminats the eyes of thoſe that are fore-ordained to life, to ſee the truth in the Scripture, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. and works in their heart faith to apprehend it, and believe it, and formes a ſpiritual judgement in their hearts to try and judge; <hi>for the ſpiritual man judgeth all things,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. And all this he works by the means of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106559:71"/> Scripture: for it is the only means and inſtrument whereby the holy Ghoſt works faith in our hearts. Thus I reaſon therefore: He only can be Judge in controverſies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whoſe authority is ſuch that none may appeal from the ſame, whoſe judgement is infallible true, who will not be partial, nor favor parties: and who is able to convict and perſwade the conſcience of the truth, and make the party to reſt in the ſame. But only the holy Ghoſt, in &amp; by the Scripture, hath theſe proprieties &amp; no other: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Ghoſt, in and by the Scripture, is only Judge.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you ſay, <hi>that the holy Writ must bear witn ſs to it:</hi> What will you ſay then to all the chief points of your Religion almoſt, which the learned and great defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of your faith, before cited, have confeſſed, are <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written traditions, which have not their beginning nor autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the Scripture, nor cannot be defended by the ſame?</hi> Upon the which I reaſon thus: That doctrine is not the holie Ghoſts, which the Scripture bears not witneſs to: this ye ſay your ſelf; for ye ſay, <hi>The Scripture must bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to it.</hi> But all the chief points almoſt of your Religion, <hi>as the ſupremacy of the Pope, the ſacrifice of the Maſs, invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints, the five bastard Sacraments, the worſhipping of Images, Tranſubstantiation, Communion under one kind, Satisfactions, Pardons, Purgatory, Merits of works,</hi> &amp;c. have not their authoritie from the Scripture, nor cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the ſame, as your own Catholicks (as ye call them) teſtifies: Therefore your Doctrine and Religion is not the holie Ghoſts, and that by your own teſtimonie. Now trulie <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> I fear ye loſe your ſtyle, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your Religion no better then this.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you ſay, <hi>That the holy Ghoſt gives out his judgement by the Paſtors of the true Church:</hi> I grant indeed that the Paſtors gives out publick ſentence in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of Religion, becauſe they are the Lords witneſſes, meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106559:71"/> and mouthes to teſtifie, proclaim, interpret and diſcern his truth from falſhood. But firſt, the rule of this their judgement, ſhould be the Word of God, unto the which they are bound in all their teſtimonies and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; from the which if their judgements ſwerve but an inch-broad, they are not the judgements of the holie Ghoſt: ſo that all their decreets and determinations in the worſhip of God, and man his ſalvation, ſhould onlie be received accordinglie as they agree or diſſent from the ſame. For the Apoſtle pronounces <hi>him accurſed, ſuppoſe he were an Angel, that would preach another Goſpel then that which he preached, Gal.</hi> 1 8. And he preached <hi>nothing but out of the Scripture, Acts</hi> 26.22. But your Roman Church by the contrary, ſaith, That their decreets and ſentences ſhould be taken <hi>without all tryal and examination, becauſe whatſoever they decree</hi> (ſay they) <hi>in manners or doctrine, whither they be comprehended in the Scripture or not, they cannot err.

                  <p>Next, if it be asked of you whom ye judge to be the Paſtors of the true Church? You will anſwer (as ye do) that your Church is the only true Church, and your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Popes the only true Paſtors, ſo that they only muſt be the Judge to end all controverſies. And <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is plain in this: for he ſaith, <hi>lib</hi> 3. <hi>de verbi interpret. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 4, <hi>de Rom. Pont. c.</hi> 2. <hi>The Pope is chief Judge in all controverſies in Religion, either he himſelf alone, or with his Council; and that in his judgement and ſentence all men ſhould reſt, and he ſhould be obediently heard of all the faithful, in all matters of controverſie, whether he can err or not.</hi> And their Canon Law hath decreeted, <hi>That no man ſhould rebuke him, ſuppoſe he ſhould carry with him innumerable ſouls to hell.</hi> And they teach that their decreets ſhould not be examined of any whither they be agreeable to the Scripture or not: but that they ſhould be received as the expreſs Word of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106559:72"/> God, and the Goſpel, <hi>Diſt.</hi> 40. <hi>cap. Si Papa, Bellar. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Concil. cap.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp; Rhemiſt. annotat. in</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp; Joannes Maria verractus editus anno</hi> 1561. <hi>&amp; Hoſius lib. de expreſſ. verb. Dei, pag.</hi> 97.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, judge thou, Reader, in what ſuſpicion they have their Religion in their own hearts: They have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the holy Ghoſt ſpeaking in the Scripture, and that not only as Judge, but in the authentick Greek and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew as witneſs. So their Religion cannot ſtand, if the Lord be either as Judge in his Scripture to give out ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of it, or as witneſs in the authentick copies, to hold his hand at the bar, and depone againſt it. Now whom would they have as Judges? Their own Paſtors, and the Pope, and all their determinations to be received without a tryal, as the Goſpel and expreſs Word of God; as though their Religion could not be juſtified, unleſs the Fathers, and forgers thereof, the Popes and Biſhops of Rome, were ſet on the bench to be Judges thereof. Now what an unrighteous thing is this, both to be partie and Judge? For the chief controverſie is of themſelves, whither he be the Antichriſt, or not? And his Miniſters and Church Antichriſtian, or not? But what ſhow of reaſon can you have for this? The Prince of life, the Son of God, who is the righteous Judge of the whole world, in that great controverſie wherein it is called in queſtion, whether he was the Meſſias, or not, deſired not to be the Judge: For he ſaid, <hi>If I testifie of my ſelf</hi> (much more if I judge of my ſelf) <hi>my teſtimony is not true, John</hi> 3.31. but referred this controverſie to the Scripture, ſaying, <hi>Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 5.32. And yet you that are but fleſh and blood, duſt and aſhes, yea monſters and incarnat Devils (as your own Writers and Councils have teſtified of ſome of your Popes) who may err, and have been hereticks (as ſome of your Popes have been, and that by your own
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106559:72"/> teſtimonies) you will not only bear witneſs of your ſelves, but alſo be Judges in the controverſies of your ſelves, reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the judgement of the holy Ghoſt in the Scripture. <hi>All men,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>are liars.</hi> How then ſhal I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainlie know but they may lie? How ſhal my conſcience reſt in their judgement? Shal I have no better warrant for my ſalvation, then the teſtimonies of your Biſhops and Popes, who are but men, and ſo may lie; who are partie, and ſo never will condemn themſelves, &amp; who of all men have moſt foully erred? What is this but to make the voice of your Biſhops and Popes of greater authoritie then the voice of God in his Scripture? For ſeeing it is the ſenſe of the Scripture that is called in controverſie, and the ſenſe of the Scripture, is the Scripture it ſelf: And your doctrine is, that I muſt embrace ſuch and ſuch interpretations of the Scripture that are called in controverſie, and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience muſt reſt in the ſame, without further tryal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath ſo decreed it. What is this, but not only to make him equal to the Lord? (For God only hath that priviledge to be believed, becauſe he ſo ſpeaks; mans te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony ſo far only is to be credited, as it may be warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Scripture:) but alſo to preferr his authoritie to the voice of God in his Scripture, ſeeing he is Judge of the ſame; and not that onlie, but to hang my ſalvation upon his voice and teſtimonie? And ſeeing ye will have them Judges, what is the cauſe that their Canons, Laws and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations, are not as authentick as the Scripture, and inſert in the Canon of the Scripture? But let us ſee your reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, you ſay, <hi>That the holy Ghoſt was given to the Church by the Father and the Son, that he might teach it all truth.</hi> I grant this, that the holy Ghoſt is given to every one of the elect, as wel Paſtor as people, to lead them in all truth, in ſo far as may bring them to ſalvation. And yet ye will not make
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106559:73"/> every one of them Judges: next, every one of the elect may err, notwithſtanding of this promiſe, ſuppoſe not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and finally, and therefore cannot be Judges of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, you alledge the example of the Council of the Apoſtles and Elders. It is true in that controverſie that aroſe among the Chriſtians concerning the obſerving of the ceremonies of the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the Apoſtles and Elders with the whole Church after reaſoning defined the ſame, and writes the ſame to be obſerved by the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples everie where: but firſt they were Apoſtles, and was infallibly governed by Gods Spirit, that they could not err in teaching and writing: but your Paſtors are not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and may err. Next, they aſſemble with the Elders and the whole Church, and all with one accord defines, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.12.22.23. You in your Council excludes all, except your Biſhops, to be ordinary Judges, to give out judgement, and your Popes, neither Elder nor brethren having power of voting with you, <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Concil. cap.</hi> 1. Thirdly, they define according to the Scripture, ſaying, <hi>As it is written, &amp;c. Act.</hi> 15.15. This controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to make us to underſtand, if we will not be more then blind, that this rule ſhould be followed in all Councils to determine in controverſies according to the Scripture. Upon the which I reaſon, if the Apoſtles who had that high meaſure of Gods Spirit which never man had ſince, ſo that in writing and teaching they could not err; if they, I ſay, did determine the controverſies of Religion accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scripture, how much more then are all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors ſince, who may err both ſeverally and jointly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Council, bound to follow the ſame rule? And whereas ye call their Elders, Prieſts; you ſtile them, not as the holy Ghoſt hath ſtiled them there, ſo there they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; that is Elders, and not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. that is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing Prieſts, as ye ſuppone.</p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:106559:73"/>
                  <p>Your third reaſon is, the practiſe and cuſtom of the Church in deciding the controverſies of Religion in Councils: we grant, that this is a very commodious mean to ſearch and find out the truth by the Scripture: For firſt, the more they are that ſeek the truth, it is the more eaſily found. Next, the conſent of many in determining a truth, will be of greater authority to repreſs hereticks, then if it were agreed upon only by a few. But yet they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine nothing but that which is warranted by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and their determinations only in ſo far forth to be received as is agreeable to the ſame. And this we grant hath been done in the Council of the primitive Church. And therefore the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſpeaking to the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Sunt libri Prophetici &amp; Apoſtolici qui apertè quid credendum ſit, docent, &amp;c.</hi> That is, there are the Books of the Prophets and Apoſtles, who teacheth plainly what we ſhould believe. All contention therefore laid aſide, let us take the ſoveraign deciſion of theſe things which are called in controverſie, out of the Scriptures which are inſpired by God. And this we grant, and this we require. But, that Councils ought to determin any thing of their own authority in matters of Religion which binds the conſcience, without the warrant of the Word, that we deny.</p>

                  <p>You wonder that I refer any thing to the Scripture.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106559:74"/> But what a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der is this that ye are ſo far blinded of God, that you think that a wonder in me which <hi>Abraham</hi> hath done, which the Prophets have done, which our Savior and his Apoſtles have done, and which the Fathers have done (for all theſe have referred the infallible teſtimony and deciſion of the will of God concerning his worſhip unto the Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 16 29. <hi>John</hi> 5 39. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>and</hi> 16.26. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1 3. <hi>cap. ult.</hi>) yea, which your ſelf alſo hath done, for ye make it a witneſs. But what hath moved you to think this a wonder in me, which ſo many, and your ſelf alſo have done before me? Becauſe, ſay ye, that he and his (that is, our Church) have no warrant that it is the Word of God, but by the authoritie of the Roman or Papiſt Church. I grant indeed, that you and your Church are plunged in this blindneſs and miſerie, that all the warrant that you have not only of the Scriptures themſelves, that they are inſpired of God, but alſo of all your doctrine and Religion, is the teſtimony of your Roman Church; that is, of your Pope and Clergy (for ſo ye interpret the Church.) So <hi>Bellarmin</hi> grants, <hi>de Sacr. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. <hi>That all the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all doctrine depends upon the authority of the preſent Church</hi> (meaning the Pope and his Clergy.)

And <hi>Hermannus</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Scripture would be of no more authority then the fables of Eſop, were not the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Church.</hi> And ſo blind and miſerable muſt you be that hangs the certaintie of all Religion, and of man his ſalvation, upon ſo ſmal a threed as the teſtimony of your Popes and Clergy. What peace in conſcience can any
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106559:74"/> man have that profeſſes your Religion, which teaches that the certainty and warrant of all the doctrine in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Scripture it ſelf, that they are of God, but the teſtimony of your Popes and Clergy? What is it to expone the certainty of the Lords Scripture, and of all Religion comprehended in the ſame, to the mocking and deriſion of the wicked, if this be not? Yea, is not this to prefer the voice and authoritie of your Popes and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie to the voice of God himſelf? For what is the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of your Church, but the teſtimonie of men? And is not the Scripture the teſtimonie and voice of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Do ye not therefore lift up the authoritie of your Church; that is, your Popes and Clergie, above the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of God in his Word, which (as you ſay) that there is no other warrant of the Divinitie of the Scripture, but only the teſtimonie of your Church? But God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in Chriſt Jeſus, who hath delivered us from this blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for we have other warrants, whereupon the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of our ſalvation, and the Divinitie of the Scripture depends, then by the teſtimonie of the true Church, much leſs the teſtimonie of your Church which is Antichriſtian, and given over of God to believe lies, and ſo worthy of no credit. But how prove ye it? Ye ſay there was no other Church immediatly before <hi>Luther,</hi> but that of yours, which was worthy of credit. Whereunto I anſwer: firſt, that is falſe: for there was a true Church immediatly before him which ye perſecuted, as I have proved elſe where. Next, I ſay, your argument will not follow: there was no other Church immediatly before him, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> we have no other warrant that the Scripture is the written Word of God. For we have alſo the teſtimony of the Church of the Jews concerning the Old Teſtament, and of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church in all ages, concerning both the Old and New Teſtament; which are not only other warrants then
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106559:75"/> the teſtimonies of your Roman Church, but alſo worthie of more credit. Next, I ſay, we have many more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, and more effectual warrants that the Scripture is of God, then the teſtimony of the Church, either paſt or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: As firſt, the teſtimonie of the holy Ghoſt, crying, teſtifying, and ſealing up in all conſciences of the godly, not only the truth of the doctrine contained in them, but alſo the Divinitie of the Scripture, which <hi>Stapleton lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de authorit. ſcript. cap.</hi> 1.6.7. denyes not; and therefore the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That the Spirit</hi> (that is, the holy Ghoſt) <hi>hears witneſs that the Spirit</hi> (that it is the doctrine) <hi>is truth.</hi> 1. <hi>John</hi> 5 6.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the teſtimony of the Scripture it ſelf warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and teſtifying of it ſelf, <hi>the whole Scripture is inſpired of God.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. The Old Teſtament warranted both by the teſtimony of its ſelf, the hiſtories and propheſies te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying of the books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and alſo by the teſtimony of the New Teſtament, both in general, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19 <hi>Luke</hi> 24.44. <hi>and</hi> 16 29 <hi>John</hi> 5.39. and alſo in particular, as the books of <hi>Moſes, Matth.</hi> 1.5. <hi>and</hi> 19.7. <hi>and</hi> 22. <hi>John</hi> 3.14. and the hiſtorical books, as the hiſtory of the Queen of <hi>Saba, Matth.</hi> 12. and of the widow of <hi>Sarepta, Luke</hi> 4. and of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> in ſundry places, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>and</hi> 13. and of ſundrie of the books of the Old Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and <hi>Ruth</hi> alſo, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. and out of <hi>Iſaiah, Ezechiel,</hi> and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> many teſtimonies are cited, and out of the Books of the ſmal Prophets. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.42. And ſuch like the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament hath the confirmation of it out of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For whatſoever thing were propheſied in the Old Teſtament concerning the Meſſias, are fulfilled in the New Teſtament: ſo if the Old Teſtament hath authority, the New Teſtament alſo hath authority. And ſuch like <hi>Peter</hi> by his teſtimonie confirmes the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> to be the written Word of God. Thirdly, the majeſtie of the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106559:75"/> doctrine which ſhines in it: the ſimplicitie, puritie, and heavenlineſs of the ſpeach therein, which is not to be found in any other writings whatſoever: the ancientneſs and antiquitie of them, as the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> far ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any other writing. The accompliſhment of the Propheſies and Oracles in them, as they were fore-told: their miracles and wonders whereof they teſtifie: the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the holy Martyrs that ſhed their blood in the defenſe of the truth of them: their wonderful preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, notwithſtanding of the rage and cruelty of ſundry tyrants who ſought them out moſt diligently to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them, all teſtifying of the Divinity of the holy Scripture. So then to conclud this, ſeeing we have the teſtimony of Gods Spirit, ſealing up the truth of them in our hearts, and the teſtimony of the Scripture it ſelf, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying of its ſelf ſo many manner of wayes; and ſundry other arguments out of the Scripture it ſelf, and the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Church in all ages, all warranting to us the Divinity of the holy Scripture, I cannot but wonder at the unſearchable judgement of God, in blinding you ſo far, that ye have ſet it down in writ, that we have no other warrant of the holy Scripture, but the authority of your Church.</p>

For if you and your Roman Church were ſo perſwaded, wherefore then ſhould ye have declined to have it tryed by the ſame? And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have ſome of your own chief pillars and defenders of your Roman Religion who knows the certaintie of the ſame; wherefore, I ſay, would they have proclaimed it by writ unto the world, that the moſt part and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal heads of their Religion, are unwritten traditions, which have neither their original, beginning, nor autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in the Scripture, nor cannot be defended by the ſame?

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106559:77"/> we grant that it is a moſt effectual ſeal and pledge of our ingrafting in Chriſt Jeſus, and of the remiſſion of our ſins through his blood, and regeneration through his Spirit; ſo that either the neglect or the contempt of it (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the neglect and contempt of the covenant it ſelf, and of Chriſt Jeſus the foundation of the covenant) is damnable. But that it is ſo abſolutly neceſſary to infants, that without it they cannot come to heaven; to wit, theſe whom he hath predeſtinat, it being neither neglected nor contemned, but death preventing the receiving of it: that we allutterly deny as impious, ungodly, and cruel.</p>

And this <hi>Peter</hi> alſo teſtifies, <hi>The promiſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is made to you and to your children, Acts</hi> 2.39. And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That the children of the faithful are holy,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. Therefore the children of the faithful who are of Gods ſecret election, ſuppoſe they die without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, do not periſh.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie, if Baptiſm were abſolutly neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, then the grace of God were bound to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This cannot be denyed But your <hi>Maſter of Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> ſaith, that the grace of God is not bound to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and it is impious ſo to think, that Gods free grace and ſalvation is bound to the inſtrument.</p>
                  <p>Thirdlie, if Circumciſion was not abſolutly neceſſary to ſalvation in the Old Teſtament, then Baptiſm is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly neceſſary now, becauſe Circumciſion was as ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyned to them, as Baptiſm is enjoyned to us, and Baptiſm is ſuceeded in the room of the ſame, but Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106559:77"/> is not abſolutly neceſſarie. For <hi>Lombardus</hi> is rebuked by the Doctors of <hi>Paris</hi> becauſe he ſo thought. And <hi>David</hi> doubts not to ſay of his child who died the ſeventh day, and ſo before he was circumciſed, <hi>I ſhal go to him, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo he pronounced that he was ſaved: and all the time that they were in the wilderneſs, almoſt 40 years, Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was neglected; which plainly ſhows, that it was not ſo abſolutly neceſſary, that ſalvation could not be obtained without it. Therefore Baptiſm is not ſo abſolutly neceſſary to ſalvation, as ye ſuppoſe: for the grace of God is of no leſs force in the New Teſtament, then it was in the Old.</p>
                  <p>Fourthlie, we read of ſundry that received the holy Ghoſt before they were baptized, and ſeeing the holy Ghoſt where he is, regenerats to eternal life: Therefore life eternal is not bound abſolutly to Baptiſm</p>
                  <p>Fifthlie, what a croſs and diſturbance is this, that your doctrine brings to the conſciences of all theſe parents, whoſe children have been prevented by death, before they could be offered to be baptized? If they believe your doctrine, how often will this come in their mind, that their children are damned? And ſeeing the infants themſelves are not in the cauſe that they are not bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, but their death preventing by Gods providence, or the Parents neglecting or contemning the ſame, or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or one impediment or other hindering, wherefore are ye ſo cruel to judge them to be damned for that, whereof themſelves are cauſeleſs?</p>
                  <p>And laſt of all, if ye be acquainted in the Hiſtories of the Church of God in the firſt age, ye will find many that delayed to be baptized, until their latter age; which they would never have done, if they had thought it ſimpliciter neceſſary to ſalvation, as ye do. And <hi>Ambroſius</hi> doubts not to ſay, That <hi>Valentinian wanted not the grace of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſuppoſe he wanted Baptiſm it ſelf:</hi> the which he would
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106559:78"/> never have ſaid, if he had thought it abſolutly neceſſary to ſalvation. And <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith <hi>I cannot altogether deſpair of the ſalvation of them who wants Baptiſm, not through contempt, but only through impoſſibility to get it.</hi> And in that ſame place he ſaith; <hi>So alſo if our Savior Chriſt for this cauſe, when he had ſaid, he that believeth and is baptized, ſhal be ſaved: did of purpoſe in repeating the ſentence, omit to ſay: He that is not baptized, but he that believeth not, ſhal be damned; for he ſaw that faith only might ſuffiſe to ſalvation, and without faith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſuffiſe.</hi> Juſtly then might your Popes ſentence and your own be ſaid to be cruel, in our confeſſion. But how prove ye this doctrine of yours to be Chriſts? Ye cite <hi>John</hi> 3.2. where our Savior ſaith, <hi>Except a man be born again, &amp;c.</hi> which, ſay ye, is properly meant of the Sacrament of Baptiſm. Upon the which ye infer the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the ſame. Whereunto I anſwer, that interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of yours is falſe: for our Savior ſpeaks not here of the Sacrament of Baptiſm: and that for theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, our Savior ſpeaks here generally of all men, and not of infants only, and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Except a man be born, &amp;c.</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> who was a man and not an infant, ſo that if your expoſition were true, all men that died without baptiſm, and not infants only, are excluded from heaven. But that is falſe: for firſt the good thief was not baptized with water, and yet our Savior ſaid to him, <hi>This night thou ſhall be with me in paradiſe.</hi> And therefore our Savior ſpeaks not here of the Sacrament of Baptiſm: for he ſpeaks of that new birth by water and the ſpirit, without the which none can be ſaved: but this thief and others, were ſaved without the Baptiſm of water: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſpeaks not here of it.</p>
                  <p>Next, our Savior in that place ſpeaks of that new birth by the ſpirit and water, which is ſo abſolutly neceſſary to the ſalvation of all men, that it admits no exception. This
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106559:78"/> cannot be denyed. But <hi>Bellarmin</hi> makes two exceptions againſt the abſolut neceſſity of Baptiſm: one of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, the other of true converſion and pennance, whereof, ſaith he, either of them ſupplies the want of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Baptiſ. cap.</hi> 6 Therefore our Savior ſpeaks not here of the Sacrament of Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if we will believe Chriſt Jeſus expounding himſelf, and Scripture expounding Scripture, I ſay, by water is not alwayes meant the Sacrament of Baptiſm; but the purifying grace of Chriſt, which is called the water of life; ſo our Savior ſpeaks in <hi>John</hi> 4.11. <hi>and</hi> 7.38. And in that ſame ſenſe water is here added to the ſpirit, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the more ſenſibly the efficacy of the Spirit in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and cleanſing us, as fire is added to the Spirit in the third of <hi>Matthew,</hi> 11. <hi>verſe, He will baptize you with the Spirit and with fire;</hi> which is not properly underſtood of any natural fire, but taken figuratively to expound more ſenſibly the force and efficacy of the Spirit, in burning up our corruption.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, what an abſurd thing were this which ſhould follow, if your expoſition were true, that for the want of the ſprinkling of a little water, the infants ſhould periſh that are in the covenant, ſeeing they were not the cauſe of the want of it.</p>
                  <p>Further, I ſay, that ſuppoſe Baptiſm were here meant, yet there is no ſuch neceſſitie, as ye ſuppoſe; for if martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and pennance may ſupplie the want of this water (as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confeſſeth) how much more may the holy Ghoſt ſupply the want of the ſame in infants: and if any thing may ſupply the want of it, then it is not ſo abſolutly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that all theſe infants are damned that wants it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Savior ſpeaks as generallie and abſolutlie, <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you, John</hi> 6.53. which ye interpret of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106559:79"/> other Sacrament: ſo that if your interpretation were true, the Euchariſt ſhould be as abſolutly neceſſary to the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of infants, as you ſay Baptiſm is. But the firſt you will not grant. Therefore the other muſt alſo be falfe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If here ye would infer a neceſſity of Baptiſm, then I ſay at that ſame time it began to be neceſſary: for he ſaith not, <hi>He that ſhal not be born again,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but he that is not born,</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith. <hi>lib. de bapt. cap.</hi> 5. It was not neceſſary while Chriſts death, yet not while the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt fifty days after his death; therefore it is not like that any neceſſity of Baptiſm is here underſtood: for it had been good reaſon that Chriſts Baptiſm which was mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred while he lived in the fleſh, ſhould have been as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as the Apoſtles Baptiſm which was miniſtred after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward But the firſt was not abſolutly neceſſary, as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> teſtifies, therefore neither is the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>And laſt of all, leſt ye ſhould ſay all this is our expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Master of the Sentences</hi> expounding this place, <hi>ſent. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>diſtinct</hi> 4. <hi>cap. His autem,</hi> who ſuppoſe he be of this judgement with you concerning infants departed, yet he ſaith that this place is to be underſtood of them who might have been baptized, but contemned the ſame: therefore this place imputes no abſolut neceſſity of it.</p>
                  <p>As for the reſt of the places of Scripture which ye quote, they ſerve nothing to prove ſuch an abſolut neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of Baptiſm, as ye ſuppoſe, but only ſets down the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the ſame which are ſealed up in the hearts of the believers by the holy Ghoſt, as the inward worker, and Baptiſm as the outward inſtrument, as our ſalvation through the death of Chriſt. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20.21. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. our union with Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. and with his death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 3.4. and remiſſion of ſins, regeneration, mortification of the old man, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.17. <hi>and</hi> 2.38. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. And therefore Circumciſion, in whoſe room
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106559:79"/> Baptiſm is ſucceeded, it is called <hi>the ſeal of righteouſneſs which is by faith, Rom.</hi> 4. Take away therefore your expoſition from theſe places, and there will no ſuch abſolut neceſſitie of Baptiſm follow here, as ye ſuppoſe. And therefore <hi>Bellarmin</hi> the learnedſt of your writers, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de ſacr. bapt. cap.</hi> 4. becauſe he knew that theſe places which ye quote here could not prove ſuch an abſolut neceſſitie of Baptiſm, nor have no appearance to prove the ſame, doth not cite one of them for the proof of the neceſſity, except only the third of <hi>John,</hi> leaving all the reſt. And as for that of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> we grant he was of that mind, that Baptiſm was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to infants, but he was alſo of that judgement, that the Euchariſt was neceſſary unto them; and yet your Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, nor you neither, I hope, will ſubſcribe to this error of his. Seeing therefore you diſſent from him in the neceſſity of the one, and that upon good ground of the Scripture; why may not we alſo diſſent from him in the other, having ſo many grounds and reaſons out of the Word of God to the contrary, as hath been ſaid? And this for the firſt point. Now let the Chriſtian Reader judge upon whoſe ſide the Word of God is.</p>

                  <p>SEcondly, our doctrine is, that a man by the grace of God, may keep the Commands of God, and obey him, which is contrary to their Confeſſion of Faith. Our doctrine in this, is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If you will enter into life, keep the commands, Matth.</hi> 19.17 And again, <hi>If ye love me, keep my commands, John</hi> 14.25 24. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29 30. And in another place, <hi>He that loves me not, keeps not my words,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106559:80"/> 
                     <hi>Take up my yoke upon you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For my yoke is ſweet, and my burden light.</hi> Now I believe that no man can deny, but this yoke and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Chriſt, is his Commands and Laws. This ſame doctrine the Apoſtles teached. S. Paul ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>and</hi> 2.13. <hi>I can do all things in him that comforts me.</hi> And before, <hi>For it is God that works in you both to will, and to accompliſh according to his good will.</hi> And S. John 1.5.3. ſaith, <hi>This is the charity of God, that we keep his Commands, and his Commands are not heavy.</hi> Now further then theſe we read that <hi>Noe, Gen.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 26.5. <hi>Job</hi> 1.22. were juſt men, and obeyed God. And S. Luke 1.6. ſaith, that <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his wife, were both juſt before God, and walked in all the commands and juſtification of our Lord without blame. There are many other places in the Old Teſtament of the ſame matter, of the which I have noted ſome, as 3. <hi>Kings</hi> 14.8.4. <hi>and</hi> 18.3.4. <hi>and</hi> 20.3.4. <hi>and</hi> 23.25. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.15. Now hold away from theſe places the Miniſters Commentaries, and I believe that all men will confeſs, that our doctrine in this, and the doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles is all one.</p>

                  <p>It appeareth that <hi>M. Gilbert</hi> is loath that the ſecrets of the doctrine of his Church ſhould be known to the people, becauſe he knows in his heart they would abhor the ſame, their own hearts and conſciences witneſſing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Therefore he hath hid up the poyſon of it, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it as ſecretly as he could But that wherein you are dark, the reſt of your Roman Clergy are plain.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, where as ye ſay, that a man by the grace of God, may keep the Commands, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> expones more clearly and ſayes, <hi>By the help of the grace of God, Lib. de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtific. cap.</hi> 10. And the Monks in that form of abjuration ſet out <hi>anno</hi> 1585 ſaith, <hi>That man by the new ſtrength of grace infuſed in good will, may keep the commands.</hi> So that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as your words would ſeem to import that the grace of God is the only cauſe of this obedience to Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments in the faithful, and ſo I think every one almoſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106559:80"/> who is not acquainted with the doctrine of your Roman Church will take it, and ſo it may be ye teach them. The reſt of your brethren are more plain, in halfing it betwixt free-will, and the grace of God helping free-will, as though the ſtrength of nature were the more principal cauſe, and the grace of God but a helper to it.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, whereas ye ſay, that a man by the grace of God may keep the, Commandments of God, and obey them, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith more plainly, <hi>cap.</hi> 19 <hi>pag.</hi> 364 <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 2 <hi>de juſtifi. cap.</hi> 3. That <hi>the Law of God is abſolutely poſſible unto them, and they may abſolutly fulfil the Law, and keep the whole Law; and that the works of the righteous are abſolutly and ſimpliciter righteous, and proceeding of a perfect holineſs, without all blemiſh of ſin, and that they pleaſe God, not for the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſs, covering their imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and forgiving them, but for the excellencie of the work it ſelf.</hi> So this is their doctrine, Chriſtian Reader. Now, as he hid his own, ſo hath he hid ours alſo. For our Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith ſaith, That our ſanctification and obedience to Gods Law is imperfect, which word he omitted: as though it had been our doctrine that the children of God in no meaſure, nor degree keep the Commandments of God. Our doctrine therefore is this: That of our own nature <hi>we are dead in ſin, Eph.</hi> 2.1. <hi>and of our ſelves we are neither able to understand,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>nor think,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. <hi>nor will, nor do thoſe things</hi> that are pleaſant to God, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> 2.13. and therefore we muſt be born anew again, <hi>John</hi> 3 5. ere we can do any thing that is acceptable in Gods ſight, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. and this ſanctification of ours is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect while we are in this life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14 15. but imperfect, ever ſome darkneſs, ſome rebellion, ſome dregs of the old man yet remaining in us, ſo that <hi>we know but in a part,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12 and our will is but renewed in part, and our heart ſanctified in part, from the which it cometh, that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106559:81"/> firſt we do not all the good that we are bound to do, and would do, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom</hi> 7 15.16.17.18.19. 20.21.22.23 24. Next, that all our righteouſneſs, as the Prophet ſaith, is but <hi>as a menſtruous cloth, Eſai.</hi> 64.6. ever ſmelling ſomewhat of the corruption of the old man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us: and ſo, that they have need to be covered with the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and their imperfection to be pardoned. By the only ſtrength therefore of Gods Spirit who works both to will, and to do in us, we begin here obedience to the whole Law of God, but yet are not able perfectly ſo to keep it, as our works may abide to be tryed before the Lord in the ballance of his Law: and therefore we place the whole hope of our ſalvation in the only mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who is made to us of God, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemption:</hi> by whoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy we obtain the perfect remiſſion or our ſins: and ſo we conclud with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 32. <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe ſins are forgiven him, and whoſe iniquities are covered.</hi> This now is the verie ſimple truth both of our doctrine and theirs in this head.</p>
                  <p>Now to anſwer you. Whereas ye ſay, That a man by grace may keep the Commandments of God: if you mean that the only cauſe of the obedience of the children of God to his Law, is the renewing grace of God, and that this obedience is ſincere and hearty, not to one, but to all the Commandments: not only outward, but inward: ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not in that high meaſure of perfection that the Law of God requires: then, I ſay, you contradict the doctrine of your Roman Church, and forſakes their error of free-will concurring with grace, and of the perfection of man his obedience here to the Law, and ſo ſhakes hands with the truth of God which we profeſs in this point. And ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coms a bad defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of their Catholick faith, as ye ſtile your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And would to God your eyes were opened ſo to ſee
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106559:81"/> and believe, ſuppoſe ye loſt that ſtile for ever. But if ye make free-will the principal cauſe of this obedience (as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> calls it:) and if ye underſtand a perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience (as your Church teaches) then firſt, tell me why did ye not ſpeak as plainly as you thought? Were you afraid that the hearts of men ſhould have skunnered with this your doctrine, if ye had been as plain in your writ, as ye are in your own judgement? Next, I ſay, you have the Lord in his written Word, as contrary to this your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as light is to darkneſs. For as to the firſt, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teſtifies plainly that <hi>we are dead in ſin, John</hi> 5.25. <hi>Col.</hi> 2 13. <hi>Eph</hi> 2.1. And that the <hi>wiſdom of the fleſh, is enmity against God, Rom.</hi> 8.17. and therefore we have need <hi>to be born again, John</hi> 3.5. that is, to receive a new life ere ever we can be able to enter into the Kingdom of God: and that <hi>it is God that worketh in us both to will and to do, Philip.</hi> 2.13. and that <hi>of our ſelves we are not ſufficient to think any thing as of our ſelves,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 5. and that <hi>all the imaginations of mans heart, is only evil continually, Gen.</hi> 6 5. Where then is there any place left to free-will?</p>
                  <p>And as to the ſecond, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.20. <hi>There is not a righteous man in the earth, who doth good and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not:</hi> therefore no perfect keeping of the Law. And <hi>who may ſay, my heart is clean, and I am pure from ſin, Prov.</hi> 20.9. If no man may ſay ſo, then no man can keep perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the whole Law. And <hi>by the works of the Law, no fleſh is justified in his ſight, Rom.</hi> 3.20.28. therefore no fleſh is able perfectly to keep the Law; for if he could keep the Law, he would be juſtified by the Law. But the Apoſtle ſaith, that no fleſh can be juſtified by the Law: therefore none can keep the Law. And therefore the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>That the Law is impoſſible, becauſe of the weakneſs of the fleſh.</hi> For the which cauſe the Son of God took on him our nature to fulfill this impoſſibility of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106559:82"/> the Law. And <hi>James</hi> calls the Law <hi>a yoke, which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>neither we nor our fathers were able to bear, Acts</hi> 15.10 If they ſaid, that they could not bear it, that is, perfectly obey it, who obtained a higher meaſure of grace then ever any ſince did, what ſhal we then ſay of all other men after them? And what arrogancy and preſumption is this in theſe of the Roman Church, to ſay and to bear others in hand, that they are able to bear that yoke which the Apoſtles was not able to bear? And JESUS CHRIST hath taught us to pray dayly, <hi>Forgive us our ſins, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> 6. which needed not, if we were able to keep the whole Law. And beſide the plain teſtimony of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, every mans own doleful experience tells them of their manifold and continual ſinning. What a damnable doctrine is this then which blinds their eyes ſo far, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſee nor feel the inward corruptions of their own heart within them, rebelling againſt the Law of God, nor yet the perfection which the Law of God requires?</p>
                  <p>Now to the teſtimonies of Scripture which ye quote: And firſt, that in the 19. of <hi>Matthew, If you would enter into life, keep the Commandments.</hi> I anſwer: The ſame is to be ſaid to you who ſeek for life &amp; righteouſneſs by the works of the Law, <hi>Keep the Commands.</hi> But that are ye unable to do, or any man elſe, except the man the Lord Jeſus, as hath been proved: and as unable as this young man was, to whom it was ſaid at the laſt, <hi>It is as impoſſible to him to go into heaven as to a camel or cable rope to go through the eye of a needle.</hi> But ye will ſay, Wherefore then would our Savior Chriſt have commanded him to keep the Commandments, if he would have life? I anſwer: Not becauſe he was able to do it, but to bring him to a conſcience of the breach of it: <hi>For by the Law,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>cometh the knowledge of ſin, Rom.</hi> 7.7. And to caſt down that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that he had of himſelf, that he had obſerved and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106559:82"/> kept the Law, that in conſcience of ſin, he might be brought to ſeek for life eternal in Chriſt Jeſus only.</p>
                  <p>And leſt ye ſay that this is my expoſition, therefore hear what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.14. <hi>As many as are of the works of the Law, are under the curſe: for it is written, Curſed is every man that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the Law to do them: and that no man is justified by the Law in the ſight of God, it is evident.</hi> Now this is ſpoken not only of the Jews, but of the Gentils that believed in Chriſt Jeſus, and were under grace. Upon the which I reaſon thus: If as many as are of the works of the Law, are under the curſe, and no man is juſtified by the Law in the ſight of God, then no man is able to get life eternal by keeping of the Law: and ſo this young man to whom Chriſt gave his anſwer, neither had kept, nor could keep the Law: but the firſt is ſaid by the Apoſtle, therefore the ſecond is true. Next, the Law requires a perfect obedience with <hi>all the heart, with all the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and thought, and ſtrength unto all the commandments, and that continually, Matth.</hi> 22.37. <hi>Luke</hi> 10 17. <hi>Mark</hi> 12.31. So that <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that breaks one, is guilty of all, James</hi> 2.10. And the Law doth pronounce them accurſed, <hi>That continues not in the doing of all things, &amp;c. Deut.</hi> 27.16. in this perfection. Now who is he that is come out of the loins of <hi>Adam</hi> (except only the Lord Jeſus) who hath continued in the perfect obedience of all things, without the breach of any, in thought, word, or deed? Are you able, or hath every one of your Roman Churches perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or is able to perform this obedience that the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires? Seeing therefore that none is able, and this young man neither had performed, not yet was able to perform this perfect obedience to the Law: therefore of neceſſity it muſt follow, that our Savior gave him this command, <hi>Keep the Commandments, &amp;c.</hi> not becauſe he was not able
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106559:83"/> to keep them, but to bring him by the Law to a conſcience of the breach of them.</p>
                  <p>As for the reſt of the Scriptures which ye bring in, they are eaſily anſwered, <hi>John</hi> 14.15 24. <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And he that loves me not, keeps not my word,</hi> &amp;c. I grant, the Lord hath commanded obedience to his Commandments. And I grant, they that loves him, keeps them; and all the children of God loves him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins alſo obedience to all his Commandments. But yet as their love is not in that perfection which the Law requires, with all their heart, with all their underſtanding, and with all their ſtrength; ſo their obedience is not in that perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And nevertheleſs the perfection of their obedience is forgiven, being covered with the perfect obedience of Jeſus Chriſt, and through him is acceptable in his preſence, and of him alſo ſhal be crowned with a crown of glory, ſuppoſe freely. And to prove this: If any had obeyed the Commandments perfectly, then ſurely the Apoſtles <hi>Paul, James, John, Peter,</hi> ſhould have done it: For they loved him in as great and greater meaſure of love, then ever any ſince did. And our Savior teſtifies of them to his Father, <hi>That they have kept his word, John</hi> 17.6. But the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies of himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7 <hi>That he did not the things he would, but the thing that he hated, that he did, and to will was preſent with him, but to perform he found it not: and he ſaw a law in his members rebelling againſt the law of his mind, and leading him captive unto ſin.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> ſaith of himſelf, and of all men, 1. <hi>John</hi> 1.8.9 <hi>If we ſay we have not ſin, we make him a lier, and the truth is not in us.</hi> And himſelf twiſe would have worſhipped an Angel. <hi>Rev.</hi> 29.10 <hi>and</hi> 22.8.9. contrary to the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6 1. And <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>That in many things we offend all, James</hi> 3 2. And <hi>Peter</hi> to whom our Savior ſaid thriſe, If thou love me, keep my laws, <hi>went not with a right foot to the truth of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106559:83"/> the Goſpel, Gal.</hi> 2.11 12. Therefore none is able perfectly to keep them.</p>
                  <p>We ſee then there is a keeping of the Commandments, and a keeping of them in perfection The firſt common to all the faithful, ſuppoſe not in an equal meaſure. The ſecond only poſſible to <hi>Adam</hi> ere he fell, and to the Saints in that Kingdom</p>
                  <p>As for the 11 of <hi>Matthew, Take up my yoke</hi> &amp;c <hi>for my yoke is ſweet, and my burden light.</hi> And the 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. <hi>his commandments are not grievous.</hi> I anſwer: Our Savior and his Apoſtles calls his commandments light, ſweet, and not heavy; not becauſe the perfection of the Law is poſſible to any to perform in this life, but firſt, becauſe the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus hath taken away the curſe of it, and alſo requires not of us that perfection which the Law requires under the pain of the curſe of the Law, if it be not ſatisfied. And becauſe he by his Spirit renews the hearts of his own, and makes them able with joy to begin that obedience; ſo that what they do, they do it not upon conſtraint, as being under the Law; but willingly for the love of Chriſt, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the ſame, according to the law of their mind, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. But yet within they find a law in their members rebelling againſt the law of their mind, leading them captive unto ſin. So in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, are his commandments called light and ſweet. But <hi>Acts</hi> 15 the Apoſtles calls it, an unſupportable yoke, which neither they nor their fathers were able to bear. And <hi>Romans</hi> 8 it is called impoſſible, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3 20. <hi>and</hi> 7.14. <hi>&amp;c. Gal</hi> 3.10. As for <hi>Philippians</hi> 4.13 where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He is able to do all things by him that ſtrengthens him.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks not here of his ability to perform the Law in that perfection which the Law requires: For he hath teſtified the contrary, both of himſelf, and of all others, as hath been ſaid. But only this,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106559:84"/> that through him he is able to ſuſtain all ſorts of condition, both to abound and to be in ſcarcity, to be full and to be hungry. This is not my expoſition, but the Apoſtle ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds himſelf in the former verſe: ſo that I wonder upon what ſhow ye could quote this teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. it is true the Lord worketh in his own both to will and to do; but yet it follows not that they are able perfectly to obey the Law. For if that meaſure of grace had been wrought in any, it had been wrought in the Apoſtles, but not in them, as hath been ſhown, and that by their own teſtimony: therefore in none elſe.</p>
                  <p>Next, what can be more clear for the overthrow of your Free-will, then is this place of Scripture? If the Lord work in us both to will and to perform, then we are not able to will of our ſelves that which is acceptable to God. As for the examples which ye cite of <hi>Noah, Abraham, Job, Zacharias,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, David, Ezechia, Joſia, Juda</hi> and <hi>Aſa,</hi> and theſe whom the Lord reſerved to himſelf pure from the Idolatry of your Antichriſtian king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fore-ſpoken there. They walked indeed in integrity and ſincerity in the commandments and ways of the Lord, and therefore have received a good teſtimony and report of Gods Spirit in the Scripture; all which we grant unto you. But that they anſwered the law in that perfection that it requires; the Scripture which hath regiſtred their walkings, and their own teſtimonies, will gain-ſay it. <hi>Noah</hi> fell in drunkenneſs, <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified by the works of the law, but by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. which is a moſt ſure argument that he fulfilled not the law. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>If I would affirm my ſelf to be righteous, my own mouth would condemn me. Job</hi> 9 2, 3.20. <hi>Zacharias</hi> believed not the word of the Lord ſpoken to him by the Angel, therefore was ſtriken dumb. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.20 <hi>David</hi> fell in adulterie, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and provoked the Lords anger by numbering the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106559:84"/> people, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12 <hi>and</hi> 24. and he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>My ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are more in number then the hairs of my head, Pſal.</hi> 40.13 And in another place, <hi>If thou mark iniquity, O Lord, who can ſtand, Pſal.</hi> 130.2. <hi>And enter not in judgement with thy ſervant, for no man living ſhal be righteous before thee, Pſal.</hi> 143.2. <hi>Ezechias heart was lifted up,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.25 <hi>Joſias harkened not unto the words of Necho, according to the word of the Lord. Aſa put his truſt not in the Lord his God, but in the King of Syria</hi> 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 16.7 The like is to be ſaid of theſe whom the Lord did reſerve to himſelf in the midſt of the kingdom of darkneſs, that they did keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God but not in that perfection which the law required. For they were not more righteous then the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> and the Apoſtles were. But the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith, <hi>That we are all unclean, and all our righteouſneſs is as a menſtruous cloth, Eſai.</hi> 64. And the Apoſtle ſaith. <hi>In many things we ſin all, James</hi> 3. And <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith <hi>All the commandments of God are accounted to be done, when that which is not done is forgiven, ad Bonif lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. And in another place. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 60. <hi>For the want of love it is that there is not a righteous man in the earth that doth good, and ſinneth not.</hi> And <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, <hi>in Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>The commandments of God are ſo great, that they are impoſſible to be kept.</hi> And <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith, <hi>in Gal.</hi> 3 <hi>Becauſe no man can fulfil the law, and do all things that is commanded.</hi> And <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cant. ſerm</hi> 5. <hi>The commandments of God cannot nor could not be fulfilled of any man.</hi> And <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith, <hi>in Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>No man hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Law.</hi> And <hi>Thomas,</hi> one of the chief pillars of your own Church, writes, <hi>in Gal</hi> 3. <hi>lect.</hi> 4. <hi>That it is impoſſible to fulfil the whole Law:</hi> and <hi>Vega</hi> a Papiſt, ſaith, <hi>lib</hi> 11. <hi>in conſil. cap</hi> 20 <hi>That venial ſins are properly againſt the Law.</hi> Upon the which I reaſon, He that daylie tranſgreſſes the law, fulfills not, nor is not able to fulfil the law (for to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the law and tranſgreſs the law, are contrarie) but your
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:106559:85"/> own doctrine is, that no man can keep himſelf at leaſt from venial ſins; and <hi>Vega</hi> (as hath been ſaid) ſaith, that venial ſins are againſt the law: Therefore if your ſelves ſpeak true, no man is able to fulfil the law. I conclud therefore, that this doctrine of yours is contrarie to the doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, ſet down in the Scripture, and alſo contrarie to the doctrine of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and contrarie to the doctrine of the moſt learned, and chief Doctors of your Roman Church. And this for the ſecond point of your doctrine.</p>

And alſo againſt their Pſalm book of Geneva. Yet our doctrine is the doctrine of Chriſt. For Chriſt ſaid to them of Jeruſalem, <hi>How oft would I have gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together thy children, but you would not? Matth.</hi> 23.37. And S. Steven. <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked and of uncircumciſed hearts and ears, ye alwayes reſiſt the holy Ghoſt, as your fathers, your ſelves alſo, Acts</hi> 7 51.

                  <p>As for this third point of doctrine, I cannot wonder enough what ye mean by it. For have you ſold your ſelf ſo far to untruth and lying, that for to bring the truth of God which we profeſs, in hatred, you will father on us that doctrine which never ſo much as once entred into our thoughts, let be to teach it or write it Did you think when you writ this, that the truth of it would never come to light? Or thought you that ye regarded not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled of lying at the laſt, ſo being that for a ſeaſon ye might make our Religion to be more abhorred through your calumnie? But froſt and falſhood (as they ſay) will never have a fair hinder end. If you mean then by reſiſting the will of God, a voluntary diſobedience and repining againſt the Spirit of God, and his revealed will in his Word, as the teſtimonies which ye quote here, imports: Then I ſay, there was never man of our Religion that profeſſed, taught, or writ the contrary: and ye will not find a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable neither in the Confeſſion of our Faith confirmed by the Act of Parliament, neither in our Pſalm book to the contrary. For our doctrine is flat contrary to this: to wit, that man of his Free-will reſiſts that that is good, and choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the contrary. So ye fight here with your own ſhadow. And if ye mean any other thing, ſet it down in plain termes; and I hope by his grace, it ſhal be anſwered So I cannot wonder enough what ye mean to write and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſo manifeſt an untruth. Now ſurelie, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> I think it had been greater wiſdom to you to have ſaved your own credit, and not for a little hatred to our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to have blotted your ſelf with lying and untruth for ever. I would pray thee, Chriſtian Reader, if thou wilt

                  <p>Fourthly, Our doctrine is, that our Savior gave his true fleſh and very body and blood under the forms of bread and wine, to be eaten of his Diſciples at his laſt Supper, and that to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their very mouth: And this I ſay by the written Word, is the doctrine of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 6.51. <hi>And the bread which I will give you, is my fleſh for the life of the world.</hi> And at the latter Supper, <hi>Take ye, and eat ye, this is my body:</hi> And, <hi>Drink ye all of this: For this is my blood of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſhal be ſhed for many unto remiſſion of ſins, Matth</hi> 26.27.28.

                  <head>M. John Welſch his Reply.</head>
                  <p>I come now to the fourth point of your doctrine, your Tranſubſtantiation and real preſence. The firſt ye quote is the 6. of <hi>John, And the bread which I will give, is my fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. This makes nothing for your real preſence. For firſt, our Savior ſpeaks not here of that ſacramental ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking of his fleſh and blood in this ſermon, which was not inſtituted a year after that: For he ſpeaks here of that eating and drinking of his fleſh and blood, without the which there is no life. So our Savior teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in the 53. <hi>verſe, Except ye eat,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</hi> But your ſelves grants that men may be ſaved without that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental eating: therefore it is not of that which he ſpeaks here. Secondly, he ſpeaks of that eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his fleſh and blood; which whoſoever ſo doth, hath eternal life to themſelves: ſo our Savior Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the 54. <hi>verſe.</hi> But your own doctrine is, that the reprobat eats and drinks Chriſts body and blood in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and yet have no life in them: therefore he ſpeaks not here of that ſacramental eating. Thirdly, if he ſpeak here of the ſacramental eating, as you ſay, then your Church not only hath erred foully, but alſo hath been and is the cauſe of the condemnation of your people theſe many years, becauſe you give them not his blood to drink. And our Savior ſaith not only, <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man,</hi> but alſo, <hi>except ye drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</hi> And this reaſon was ſo effectual, that it hath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſundry of your own Doctors, as <hi>Janſenius and Tapperus, with ſundry others,</hi> to expone this place, not of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental eating and drinking of the body and blood of Chriſt, but of the ſpiritual eating and drinking of him by faith. For they did ſee that it behoved them either to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106559:87"/> forſake this place, as not making for them, and grant that it ſpeaks not of the Sacrament: or elſe to confeſs that their Church hath erred, and through this error, hath been the cauſe of the damnation of many, in miniſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but under one kind. And becauſe you ſay, if our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions vere removed from the Scripture, they would ferve for you: whom therefore will you credit in expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this place? If our Savior, hear then how he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon s this eating and drinking of his fleſh and blood in the 35. verſe: <hi>I am the bread of life, he that cometh unto me, ſhal not hunger; and he that believes in me, ſhal never thirſt.</hi> So when we believe in Chriſt, we eat him: and when we come unto him (which is only by faith) we drink him. So <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo expones this place, <hi>Tractat.</hi> 25. <hi>in Johan. cap</hi> 6. <hi>Tract</hi> 26 <hi>&amp; de doct. Chriſt. lib.</hi> 3 <hi>cap.</hi> 16. <hi>Believe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and thou haſt eaten.

And if ye will credit none of theſe, then I hope, ye will not diſcredit your own chief Doctors, who affirms, <hi>That this place is not meant of the Sacrament, but of the ſpiritual eating and drinking of Chriſt by faith.</hi> As <hi>Biel, Cuſanus, Cai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

And if ye will reply, that many others of the Fathers have exponed this place of the Sacrament then <hi>Janfenius</hi> and <hi>Tapperus,</hi> two Papiſts, will anſwer you; <hi>That they did it only by way of application unto the readers and hearers, to ſtir them up to the often receiving of the Sacrament.</hi> So this place can ſerve nothing for your Tranſubſtantiation; for it ſpeaks not of the Sacrament, but of his ſuffering upon the Croſs for the away taking of our ſins, and the purchaſing to us of eternal life.</p>
                  <p>The next place ye quote, is the words of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and the Apoſtles rehearſes
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106559:87"/> them. Your argument is this. Chriſt calls the bread his fleſh (and ſo <hi>Paul</hi>) and the wine his blood: therefore the bread is changed in his body, and the wine in his blood, the outward formes of bread and wine only remaining. This is the chief and principal ground of your real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto I anſwer: Firſt, there is not a ſyllable here that tells us that the ſubſtance of the bread and wine is tranſchanged in the body and blood of Chriſt unleſs ye will expone this word, <hi>is my body,</hi> for, it is changed in my body, which is a monſtrous expoſition: for both it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the native ſignification of the word <hi>eſt, (Eſt &amp; Fieri, ſunt contraria)</hi> that ſignifies to be alreadie: (for to be already, and to be in a change, are contrary) as alſo it hath not the like form of ſpeach in the whole Scripture to warrant it, from the firſt of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> to the laſt of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi> Bring one inſtance if ye can. And <hi>Augustin</hi> ſaith, <hi>in Geneſ. quaest.</hi> 117. <hi>in Pſal.</hi> 105. <hi>ſupr. Num. quaeſt.</hi> 95. <hi>The ſolution of a queſtion ſhould be warranted by ſome exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the like ſpeach in the Scripture,</hi> the which you are not able to do: Therefore your expoſition is without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
                  <p>Next, I ſay, by what Art of reaſoning can you gather this doctrine out of theſe places of Scripture? Chriſt ſaith of the bread, <hi>This is my body;</hi> and of the wine, <hi>This is my blood:</hi> Therefore the outward formes of the bread and wine only remains, but the ſubſtance of them is gone. Never ſuch an inkling in all theſe texts of this doctrine of yours.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this interpretation and doctrine which reſults upon it, is falſe: and that for theſe reaſons. Firſt, becauſe it is plainly gain-ſaid by the Scripture. Secondly, becauſe it deſtroys ſundry articles of our Faith, and many blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous abſurdities doth follow upon it. Thirdly, it deſtroys
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106559:88"/> the nature of the Sacrament. And laſt of all, is utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the words of the inſtitution. My argument then is this: That interpretation and doctrine which is gain-ſaid by the plain teſtimony of the Scripture, which deſtroyes the articles of our faith, and the fundamental points of our ſalvation, which hath many abſurdities fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing upon it, which overthrowes the nature of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; and laſt of all, which is contrary to the whole inſtitution, muſt be falſe, blaſphemous and erroneous. This cannot be denyed but your interpretation of theſe words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> &amp;c. and your tranſubſtantiation which ye gather upon it, is ſuch. Therefore it muſt be erroneous, &amp;c. My aſſumption I prove thus.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, your interpretation is gain-ſaid by the plain teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Scripture. Your interpretation is, that there remains no true bread nor wine in the Sacrament, but the ſubſtance of it is changed. But <hi>Matthew. Mark, Luke,</hi> and the Apoſtles all four teſtifies, <hi>That Christ took bread, brake it, and gave it to his diſciples:</hi> And leſt ye ſhould ſay that it was true bread and wine before the conſecration, but not after, the Scripture ſaith plainly. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>that it is bread</hi> which we <hi>break,</hi> and <hi>bread which is eaten, and the fruit of the vine which is drunken</hi> in the Sacrament. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>The bread which we break.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And as oft as ye eat this bread,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whoſoever ſhal eat this bread,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of this bread,</hi> &amp;c. And our Savior ſaith, that after he had given the cup, and they had drunken of it, <hi>From henceforth ſhal I not drink of the fruit of the vine with you,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore true bread and wine remains in the Sacrament, contrary expreſly to your interpretation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That your interpretation deſtroyes the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our Faith, I prove it thus: If this be true that the bread and wine be really changed in the bodie and blood
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106559:88"/> of Chriſt in the Sacrament, as ye expound the words: Firſt, It will follow that either Chriſt aſcerded not into heaven, becauſe he remaineth in the earth in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and ſo one of the Articles of our Belief is falſified: Or elſe if ye ſay he aſcended once but yet deſcends con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to be preſent in the Sacrament, then another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Belief is falſified, which ſaith, <hi>That he ſitteth at the right hand of God his Father.</hi> And as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>abides in heaven, whom the heavens muſt contain, while the time of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of all things come, Act.</hi> 3.21. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It will follow that Chriſts bodie is made of the bread: for if the ſubſtance of the bread be changed in the bodie of Chriſt, then it muſt follow that the bread is become the bodie of Chriſt, and Chriſt his bodie is made of that bread, as the wine was made of the water at the marriage of Cana in Galilee. And ſo <hi>Bellarmin, lib</hi> 3. <hi>de Eucharist. fol.</hi> 399. and Pope <hi>John</hi> 22. <hi>lib. orat. in ſcript. antidotar, animae,</hi> and the Maſter of Sentences, <hi>Lombard. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>diſtinct.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 8 grants, <hi>that Chriſt it made of bread, and the ſubſtance of bread and wine it made Christs fleſh and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die;</hi> and ſo here another article of our faith falſified, which ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt his bodie was made of the ſeed of the woman,</hi> and not of any other matter, and <hi>like to us in all things, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdlie, It will follow that Chriſt had two bodies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, one under the form of a man, and another under the form of bread: one ſpeaking, and another dumb: one giving to his diſciples to eat, and another the ſelf ſame thing which was given to be eaten: yea, it ſhal follow, if your expoſition be true, in ſaying, That Chriſts body and blood is under the forms of bread and wine in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not only that there are two Chriſts, one in heaven at the right hand of his Father viſible, glorious and in one
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:106559:89"/> place: and another Chriſt in the earth inviſible, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by no place: but alſo that there are as many Chri s as there are Sacraments in the earth, yea, as many Chriſts as there are bits of bread in every Sacrament, and ſo the foundation of our ſalvation is overturned.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. It will follow that the body and blood of Chriſt are ſeparat, as the bread and wine in the Sacrament which is turned in them is ſeparated.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It will follow that his body is ſeparat from his ſoul, and ſo a dead bodie, becauſe the bread and wine are not changed in his ſoul, but only in his body.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, It will follow that the bread in the firſt Supper being changed in the body of Chriſt, that the ſubſtance of the bread hath ſuffered for us, died for us, and riſen again for us: and hath a part of our redemption, which is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous to think.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, It will follow that Chriſt eated his own body, and drank his own blood, which is abſurd: for <hi>Chryſoſtom, hom.</hi> 83. <hi>in Mar.</hi> and your Canon Law, <hi>de conſecr. diſt</hi> 2. <hi>Canon. Nec Moſes,</hi> teſtifies, that he ate the ſame thing which he gave to his Diſciples. And alſo he ſaith himſelf, <hi>From hence forth will I not drink with you more of the fruit of this vine,</hi> &amp;c. So he drank of that which they drank of. And laſt of all, it will follow, that the Maſs-Prieſt is the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of his Creator: and ſo their <hi>Breviaries</hi> and <hi>Lombardus,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> grants. In their Breviaries the Prieſt ſaith, <hi>Qui creavit me ſine me, creatur mediante me:</hi> that is, He that created me without me, is created by my moyen. <hi>Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> ſaith, <hi>diſtinct.</hi> 12. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>The Prieſts are ſaid to make the body and blood of Chriſt, becauſe by their miniſtry the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the bread is made his fleſh.</hi> And <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Euchariſt cap</hi> 24 <hi>Sacerdotes conficiunt corpus Chriſti ex pane, That the Prieſts makes Chriſt his body of bread.</hi> Now if there be no blaſphemous abſurdities, I know not
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:106559:89"/> what is blaſphemy. Now chooſe ye whither ye will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to all theſe abſurdities, which you with all the wit of the Roman Clergy, is not able to eſchew, if ye grant this interpretation of yours to be true: or will you forſake this interpretation of yours, as falſe, erroneous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary both to the plain Scriptures of God, and the articles of our Faith, and the grounds of our ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>As to the third: Your interpretation deſtroys the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all Sacraments, and makes the Supper of the Lord no Sacrament; for every Sacrament conſiſts of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and viſible ſign, and of a ſpiritual thing ſignified by that ſign, the which ſign hath a reſemblance with the thing ſignified. The ſign is ever earthly, and the thing ſignified is heavenly, as ſhal appear by all the reſt of the Sacraments, both of the Old and New Teſtament. In Paradiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7. there was a very tree for the ſign, and Chriſt the thing ſignified by it. In circumciſion there was a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the skin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9.20. <hi>Rom</hi> 4 11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11. and the cutting off of ſin. In the Paſsover there was a Lamb and Chriſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.8. <hi>John</hi> 19.36. And in the Sabath there was a day of reſt, and eternal reſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1 3.4.5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the Sanctuary there was an holy Place, and heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 24. In the wilderneſs there was a Rock yeelding water, and Chriſt yeelding his blood, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 4. In the apparition there was a dove, and the holy Ghoſt, <hi>John</hi> 1.32. In the Manna there was bread, and Chriſt, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3. In Baptiſm there was very water which waſheth us, and Chriſts blood waſhing our ſins, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. Therefore in the Sacrament of the Supper muſt be bread and wine feeding this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life, and reſembling our communion one with another, and Chriſts fleſh &amp; blood feeding our ſpiritual life, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. 17. otherwiſe this Sacrament is againſt the nature of all other Sacraments, which is abſurd to think, and ſhould be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106559:90"/> no Sacrament at all, as <hi>Augustin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epist.</hi> 23. <hi>If the Sacraments had not a reſemblance with the things whereof they are Sacraments, they ſhould not be Sacraments at all.</hi> But your interpretation and doctrine deſtroys both the ſign, and the reſemblance which they ſhould have with the things ſignified in the Supper; for there is no outward ſign there which is an earthly ſubſtance, but only accidents of color, and quantity, if your doctrine be true; and there is nothing there to reſemble either our ſpiritual nowriſhment by the fleſh and blood of Chriſt, or yet our ſpiritual fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip one with another: unleſs you will ſay, that accidents feeds, and nowriſhes: the which if you will ſay, then to ſay no more to it but this. If you and your common Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy who is ſo bold and ſtrong in maintaining this monſtrous Tranſubſtantiation of yours againſt the truth of God, were fed with no better ſubſtance then accidents; then, I ſay, you would have fainted long ſince in the defence of it. Seeing therefore your interpretation makes the Supper to be no Sacrament, and makes it unlike all other Sacraments, therefore it muſt be falſe and erroneous.</p>
                  <p>As to the fourth, that it is againſt the whole inſtitution and uſe thereof, I prove it thus. Firſt, I will ask you, what was it which Chriſt took in his hand? If you ſay his fleſh, then the text will ſay the contrary, <hi>And Jeſus took bread,</hi> in all the three Evangeliſts, and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi> So it was bread which he took, after he did take it, he bleſſed it: What did he bleſs, but the bread which he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? ſo it is yet bread. After he bleſſed it, he brake it. What did he break? If you ſay, it was his fleſh or body, then the Scripture will ſay the contrary: <hi>There was not a bone of him broken, Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>John</hi> 19. And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is bread which we break,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. So it is bread which is broken. Then yet it is bread. After he brake it, he gave it. What gave he but the thing which he brake?
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106559:90"/> And what brake he but bread? 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. <hi>and</hi> 11.26. 27.28. So it is bread which he gave. After he had given it, they received it, and did eat it. But what did they eat, but that which he gave? And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith four times, It is bread which is eaten, and whereof we are partakers, and that after the conſecration: For it is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, given, and received, and eaten, after the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And when they did eat it, he ſaid, <hi>This is my body.</hi> What did he call his body, but that which they did eat, and that was bread? So when then ſhould this change be, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is bread all the time while he took it, bleſſed it, and gave it, and they did eat? For, I ſuppoſe, ye will not ſay, it is changed after it is broken, and given, and in eating.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I will ask you, what are the words whereby this monſtrous change is made, as ye ſuppoſe, of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the bread in Chriſts body? If this change be made by any word ſpoken in the inſtitution of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then, I ſay, it muſt either be by this word, <hi>And he bleſſed it;</hi> or by theſe words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> &amp;c. But not by the firſt: for after he bleſſed it, he called it bread. And the Apoſtle ſaith, it is bread which we break, therefore it remains bread after the bleſſing. Not by the other words: for if they be not ſpoken to the bread and wine, they cannot change their nature. But <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith plainly, they were ſpoken to the Diſciples, <hi>And he ſaid unto them, This is my blood, Mark</hi> 14.24. Therefore they changed not their nature. And <hi>Durand</hi> a Papiſt, ſaith, <hi>in his Rationals, That this change is made by the bleſſing.</hi> Therefore not by theſe words which were pronounced after the bleſſing. And theſe words cannot work a change: For they are not words importing an operation, as theſe are, <hi>Let light be, Let the earth bring forth fruit, Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>Come out, Lazarus John.</hi> 12. and ſuch like: but only ſignifying the things themſelves, as theſe are, <hi>Thou art my well-beloved Son.</hi> So
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106559:91"/> if theſe words ſhould have wrought any change, they would not have been, <hi>This is my body,</hi> &amp;c. but, <hi>let this be my body:</hi> Therefore there is no ſuch change at all here, as ye imagine.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it ſhould follow that the cup ſhould alſo be changed in his blood, and in the New Teſtament, becauſe Chriſt calls the cup his blood and New Teſtament, as he calls the bread his body. But this you will not ſay. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then are you ſo abſurd as to ſay the other?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I will ask you whither do ye receive in the Sacrament that body which is mortal, or that body which is glorified? For one of them you muſt receive, either Chriſts body as it was mortal, or his body as it is now glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. If ye ſay a mortal body; then I ſay, Chriſt hath not a mortal body to give you now in the Sacrament, for it is glorified: therefore ye cannot receive it. If ye ſay an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal and glorified body; then I ſay, ye muſt ſeek another warrant then this text of <hi>Matthew, Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke.</hi> For at that time his body was not glorified. For the Sacrament was inſtituted before his death, and he was not glorified until after his reſurrection: And if ye receive that ſame body which the Apoſtles then received; then ye receive not a glorified body. What a body is this then which ye receive, neither mortal nor glorified?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the text ſaith, they <hi>who receives unworthily, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives their own damnation.</hi> But if Chriſts fleſh and blood were there preſent, as ye ſay, then all who received it ſhould receive their ſalvation, becauſe our Savior ſaith, <hi>He that eats my fleſh and drinks my blood, hath life everlaſting, John</hi> 6 54. Now I conclud, ſeeing your interpretation of theſe places of Scripture, and your doctrine of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation which ye gather thereupon; firſt, is plainly gain-ſaid by the expreſs teſtimonies of the Scripture; next, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws all the main foundations of our ſalvation, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106559:91"/> articles of our Faith: thirdly, deſtroys the nature of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and maketh it no Sacrament at all, and like no other Sacrament, either of the Old or New Teſtament: and laſt of all, is contrary to the whole inſtitution thereof, as I hope I have ſufficiently proved: therefore of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it muſt be falſe and erroneous</p>
                  <p>As for the 10 of the 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 16. <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion: and the bread which we break, is it not,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer: This Sacrament of bread and wine, becauſe it not only repreſents and ſeals up to us our communion with Chriſt, but alſo by it, as by a moſt effectual inſtrument, the holy Ghoſt increaſes and nowri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes this communion, both with him, and among our ſelves: therefore it is called the communion of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood But this moſt clearly proves, that there is no ſuch change here, as ye ſuppoſe: for the Apoſtle ſaith plainly, <hi>The bread which we break;</hi> and this breaking, you ſay, is after the conſecration: therefore after the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration true bread remains in the Sacrament, and ſo there is no tranſubſtantiation in the ſame. But becauſe you ſay, the ſubſtance of the bread and wine is not there, I pray you, tell me whither are they gone? Whither are they turned to nothing, or are they changed in Chriſts body? If you ſay, they are turned to nothing: Firſt, I ſay, this were a ſtrange kind of reaſoning: <hi>This is my body;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſubſtance of the bread is turned to nothing. Next, the Apoſtle ſhould not ſpeak truly, to call it <hi>bread which is broken, and bread which is eaten, &amp;c</hi> if it were turned to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Thirdly, then this ſhould not be called Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, or changing of one ſubſtance into another: but an annihilation of one ſubſtance, that is, a turning of it to nothing, and a bringing in of another ſubſtance in the room of it. And fourthly, <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin,</hi> your great defender of this doctrine, is againſt this, <hi>lib.</hi> 4 <hi>diſt.</hi> 8. But
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106559:92"/> if you ſay, they are turned in Chriſts body, which the word Tranſubſtantiation imports; then, I ſay, as oft as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament hath been miniſtrated, as oft hath there been ſome quantitie of ſubſtance added to his body: and it ſhal ſtill grow in greatneſs and quantitie, as long as it ſhal be miniſtred: but this is monſtrous to think. And to end this, if you ſay there is no ſubſtance of bread and wine left in the Sacrament, then let me ask you whoſe are the whiteneſs, and redneſs, and roundneſs that we ſee? What means this taſte in our mouthes of bread and wine, if there be no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them there? May we not ſay to you, as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Thomas,</hi> who doubted of his reſurrection, <hi>Put thy fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger here, behold my hands; put thy hand in my ſide, and be not incredulous, but believe?</hi> So, may not we ſay to you, who doubteth whither the ſubſtance of bread and wine be here remaining yet, touch them, taſte them, look on them, and feel them, and be not incredulous, but believe? For behold, there would not be ſuch a color, ſuch a taſte and ſmel, and there were not ſubſtance of bread and wine here. And I pray you, tell me what is this that rots then, and growes in worms in the bread, and ſouers in the wine, if they be long kept? If their ſubſtance remaineth not, will you ſay Chriſts fleſh and blood rots and conſumes and ſouers? What is this but to make him mortal, yea to crucifie him again? And if you will not ſay that, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt you confeſs that their ſubſtance remaines and is not changed, or elſe Chriſts fleſh and blood is tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated in theſe ſubſtances which rots and ſouers, or elſe that the accidents is changed again in their ſubſtances: and ſo ye ſhal not have one, but mo changes in your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Yea, if their ſubſtance be gone, and nothing but their accidents remaining, then how could Pope <hi>Victor</hi> the 3. and the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. have been poiſoned with them; as <hi>Faſciculus temp. Platina, Blond,</hi> teſtifieth, accidents
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106559:92"/> and Chriſts body could neither poiſon them, nor be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of poiſon: therefore they felt by experience that there was no Tranſubſtantiation in the Sacrament. So we ſee the texts ye brought with you, is againſt you, as the ſword that <hi>Goliah</hi> brought to ſlay <hi>David,</hi> cutted off his own head. But yet you will ſay, If the bread be not his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, why then did he call it his body? this is the chief thing you have for your doctrine; &amp; anſwer this, and the plea is won. Unto this then I anſwer, that in that ſame ſenſe he ſaid, <hi>This is my body:</hi> In the which he ſaid afterward, <hi>which is broken for you,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>which is given in the preſent time.</hi> But there can be no ſenſe of theſe words, but this; the bread was broken, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that his body ſhould be broken with the ſorrows of death: for his body was not broken before he ſuffered: and the Apoſtle ſaith, it is <hi>bread which is broken:</hi> ſo then as the breaking of the bread ſignified the breaking of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo the bread ſignified his body: and as his body was not broken indeed when the bread was broken, ſo the bread could not be his body in very deed when he ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it For the reſemblance and likeneſs thereof between the bread and his body, the bread it is called his body, &amp;c. and this phraſe is very frequent in the Scripture, to give the name of the things ſignified to the ſign, as ſhal be ſeen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>

                  <head>M. John Welſch his Reply.</head>
                  <p>Ye prevent our anſwers here, and firſt ye bid us hold away our natural reaſons againſt the omnipotency of Chriſt, that he cannot be in two places at once. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I anſwer, that we ſhal bring no reaſon, neither natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral nor ſupernatural, againſt the omnipotency of Chriſt, for we acknowledge it, and adores it. But we ſay to you, pretend not his omnipotency for your monſtrous imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, which have no warrant of his will in his Scripture. For firſt, we ſay this argument of yours will not follow: Chriſt is able to make his body to be in two places, both at once, in heaven, and in the Sacrament: therefore he makes it to be ſo. For you muſt firſt prove he will do ſo: for your ſelf, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> can do many things which you do not, becauſe you will not; ſo from can to will, it follows not. And if you ſay, that Chriſt hath willed ſo, becauſe he ſaid, <hi>This is my body:</hi> I have anſwered to it before, refute you it, and all your Roman Clergy, if you can. For you might as well ſay, Chriſt willed the cup wherein the wine was, to be changed in his blood and New Teſtament, and himſelf to be changed in a vine-tree, and a door, and a rock to be changed in him: becauſe ſo hath he and his Apoſtles ſpoken, <hi>John</hi> 10. <hi>and</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 <hi>and</hi> 11. and theſe ſpeaches are as true, as that; and yet there is no change here. Next, I ſay, your own School-men and great defenders of Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin,</hi> and others, ſay, <hi>lib.</hi> 1 <hi>cap.</hi> 84. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. <hi>contra Gent.</hi> That <hi>it is againſt the omnipotency of God to affirm that he may do any thing which implyes a contradiction in its ſelf; for that is rather to be called a weakneſs then a power.</hi> And the Scripture affirms, that <hi>God cannot lie, nor deny himſelf, nor be tempted, and that yea and nay it not in Chriſt, Heb.</hi> 6. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>James</hi> 1.2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. but to Chriſts body, both to be a true body,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106559:93"/> 
                     <hi>like to us in all things</hi> (to wit eſſential) <hi>except ſin,</hi> as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, and to be in mo places at once, which makes him to have not a true body like ours. For <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>ad Dardanum</hi> (ſpeaking of Chriſts glorified body) <hi>If it be a true body, it is then in a certain place: and take away from bodies their quantities, they are no more true bodies</hi>) implyes a contradiction, and is yea and nay in him: and Chriſts body both to be viſible and inviſible at one time: to be in a certain place in heaven with his own length and breadth, and not to have his own length and breadth at once in the Sacrament, is a manifeſt contradiction, is yea and nay in Chriſt: therefore both by the Scripture and your own doctrine, the omnipotency of Chriſt cannot be alledged or pretended for this your doctrine, which is yea and nay, and implyes a manifeſt contradiction. So this in very truth, is the invention of your own brain, which is alledged for your Tranſubſtantiation, and wants the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, yea is gain-ſaid both by the written Word, and your own School-men. Next, ye would have us to hold away our figurs, ſymbols, and ſimilituds: I anſwer: our own figurs we ſhal hold away: but theſe figurs, ſymbols, and ſigns, wherein our Savior hath delivered his truth to us, we muſt and will acknowledge So then, obeying rather God who hath ſet them down in his Scripture, then you who forbids us to acknowledge them: and what a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous expoſition would you make of infinit places of Scripture, if you would admit no figures in them, but all to be underſtood plainly and literally as they were ſpoken? The Scripture aſcribes to God <hi>eyes. ears, foot, hands, and a face:</hi> and the Scripture calls Chriſt <hi>a door, a vine.</hi> Now if you will admit no figurs here, but will have all theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces exponed literally, as you will have us to do in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, then you would be reckoned in the number of the old hereticks called <hi>Anthropomorphitae,</hi> who becauſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:106559:94"/> they ſaw the Scripture ſpeak ſo of God, they taking it lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and exponing it without figurs, as you would have us to expone the Sacrament, they thought that God was bodilie: yea, you muſt make another monſtrous Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation of Chriſt in a door, and vine-tree, for ſo he calls himſelf. And to come to the Sacraments themſelves, how many tranſubſtantiations will you make in all the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both of the Old and New Teſtament, if you will remove figurs and ſigns from them, and expone them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, as you would have us to do in this Sacrament. <hi>Circumciſion is called the covenant, Gen.</hi> 27. and yet it was but the ſign of the covenant: the Lamb in the Paſsover, is called the <hi>Paſsover of the Lord, Exod.</hi> 12. and yet it was but the ſign of the Paſsover: the Rock in the wilderneſs, is called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 20. and yet it was but a ſign of Chriſt: the Ark is called the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. and yet it was but a ſign of the Lord: the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> is called the reſt of the Lord. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. and yet it was but a ſign of that reſt: and Baptiſm is called the waſhing of regeneration, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. and yet it is but the ſign of our regeneration. Do you think that the forms of ſpeaches in all other Sacraments are figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively taken, and the form of ſpeach in this Sacrament only to be literally underſtood? What reaſon can there be of this diverſity? But it may be you think that the form of ſpeaches in all other Sacraments ſhould be taken figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively: but the phraſe of ſpeach in this Sacrament is to be taken literally. But firſt, what then will you ſay to this ſpeach, <hi>This is my body which is broken for you;</hi> and this, <hi>The cup is the New Teſtament in my blood, and the cup is my blood; and the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt? and the cup which we bleſs, is it not the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the blood of Chriſt?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. all figurative ſpeaches, and to be underſtood figuratively: otherwiſe Chriſt ſhould have been broken
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106559:94"/> in the Sacrament, which is both contrary to the Scripture, and alſo abſurd. For then he ſhould have ſuffered twiſe; once in the Sacrament, and once upon the croſs: and not only ſhould there be one tranſubſtantiation in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but many: as of the cup in the blood of Chriſt, and of the bread and cup in the participation of the body and blood of Chriſt: and ſo you ſhould not only have one tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, but many. And how, I pray you, can Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments which are but figurs, ſigns and ſymbols, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood but figuratively? And how can <hi>duo diverſa indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidua alterum de altero praedicari in praedicatione,</hi> and be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of another, without a figure, as it is here. <hi>This bread is my body,</hi> &amp;c. Can you or any at all of your Roman Clergy, underſtand ſuch propoſitions otherwiſe then figurativelie? What an unreaſonable thing is it then to you to forbid us to acknowledge figurs in this Sacrament, which is but a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and ſign, ſeeing they are ſo frequentlie uſed in the Scriptures of God, and eſpeciallie in Sacraments, as alſo in this Sacrament? So nil ye will ye, ſigns and ſymbols, tropes and figurs ye muſt admit in the expoſition of this Sacrament. Laſt of all, ye think a natural bodie cannot be ſpirituallie eaten. Would you be ſo abſurd and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, as to have Chriſts bodie naturallie eaten? For then his bodie muſt be naturallie chawed, digeſted, turned over in our ſubſtance, and caſten out in the draught, and ſo be mortal and ſuffer again; <hi>Apage hanc blaſphemiam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let me ask you, whither is Chriſts bodie the food of the ſoul, or the food of the bodie? If you ſay it is the food of the bodie to fill the bellie; then, I ſay, it muſt be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally eaten; but you are blaſpemous in ſo thinking. But if you ſay, it is the food of the ſoul, as it is indeed, and as our Savior ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 6.35. then it cannot be eaten natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally: For as the food of the body cannot be eaten ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, ſo the food of the ſoul cannot be eaten naturally,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:106559:95"/> but ſpiritually by faith. And if you underſtood this true eating of Chriſt by faith, all your contention would take an end. But this is the ſtone which ye ſtumble at, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye forbid us to come in with a ſpiritual eating of Chriſts natural body, as though it could be eaten other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then ſpiritually by faith Will you neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 6 35. nor the ancient Fathers, <hi>August tract.</hi> 26. <hi>in Joh.</hi> 6 <hi>&amp; lib</hi> 3. <hi>de doct.

What groſs darkneſs is this wherewith the Lord hath blinded you above all, that ye cannot underſtand it? As Chriſt dwells in us, and we in him, ſo do we eat him, and drink him. But the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>he dwells in us by faith, Epheſ.</hi> 3. therefore we eat him, and drink him by faith. And ſeeing your Church grants, that the eating of Chriſt corporally doth no good, and the eating of him by faith only will bring eternal life, as our Savior ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 6. what needs then this corporal and real eating of Chriſt? And why are ye like the groſs and carnal Capernaits, who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand no eating, but a corporal eating of him? And what is the cauſe that ye cannot underſtand the doctrine of your own Church, which acknowledges a ſpiritual ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Chriſt by faith, both by the Word and by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament alſo, <hi>de conſecr diſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap. Ut quid.</hi> I had never have thought that ye had been ſo far blinded of the Lord. But I leave you to the Lord.

Then if it were his natural body, it was not natural bread. As Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> expounds the ſame, Let us prove, ſaith he, this not to be that that nature formed, but that thing which the bleſſing hath conſecrate, and greater ſtrength to be in bleſſing then in nature: for nature it ſelf is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by bleſſing.

                  <p>Firſt, I anſwer, the words of the Apoſtle is not as ye cite them here which ſhal be delivered, but <gap reason="foreign">

                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is given; ſo you are not faithful in tranſlating this place of Scripture, both contrary to the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Syriak</hi> copies. Upon the which I reaſon thus, this propoſition is true, <hi>This is my body which is broken for you:</hi> ſo the Apoſtle ſaith; but Chriſts body was not broken then really, for not a bone of him was broken at all, as the Scripture teſtifies, <hi>Exod</hi> 12. and the Scripture ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 19. and all men confeſſes that he ſuffered but once, ſo only his ſufferings are ſignified then by the breaking of the bread in the Sacrament here: ſo as Chriſts body was not broken then really, that is, ſuffered; but his ſuffering only ſignified by the breaking of the bread, ſo his body was not given really and corporally to be eaten, but only ſignified. Secondly, I ſay, it is true, that Chriſts natural body was delivered to the death for us: but yet it will not follow upon this, that it was his natural body which he gave to them to be eaten corporally: for his natural body was
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:106559:96"/> really delivered to death for us: and it was but given to them ſpiritually to be eaten. You muſt coyn a new Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> ere you can make theſe two ſtick toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and the one neceſſarilie to follow upon the other. For by that ſame reaſon you may as well conclud, that Chriſt gave his natural body to be eaten corporally in the word, for he gives himſelf to be eaten in his word, as well as in his Sacrament, 2. <hi>John</hi> 6.35 <hi>Bellarmin</hi> grants this alſo, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Euchariſt. cap.</hi> 7. and alſo he gives that ſame body to them in the word, which was delivered to death: for the ſelf ſame Chriſt is offered and received as well in the word as in the Sacrament. So from his bodilie death, to a corporal eating of him, it will not follow. And further by that ſame reaſon you may as well ſay, that the Fathers before Chriſt under the Law, did eat Chriſts body corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, for they ate that ſame ſpiritual food, and drank that ſame ſpiritual drink, in their Sacraments, which we do now in ours. So the Apoſtle teſtifies, even that ſelf ſame Chriſt his body and blood which was delivered to the death, and yet it will not follow, that they did eat his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body, &amp;c. As for <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> it is true he ſo ſpeaks, but he expones himſelf in that ſame chapter, while as he ſaith, <hi>Before the bleſſing another form or thing is named, but after the conſecration, the body of Chriſt is ſignified.</hi> If the bread then ſignifie the body of Chriſt, it is not changed in his body. And becauſe of this holy uſe to ſignifie the body of Chriſt, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, That <hi>the nature is changed by bleſſing:</hi> and that this is his meaning, his words following will declare it, where he ſaith, <hi>Shal not the words of Chriſt be of force to change the form of the elements.</hi> In that ſame ſenſe <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, the nature of the elements is changed, in the which he ſaith, the form of them is changed, for he affirmeth both there. But ye will not ſay, I ſuppoſe, unleſs you will overthrow your tranſubſtantiation, that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> means;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106559:96"/> that the form of the elements is changed in ſubſtance, but only in uſe and ſignification; for you ſay the forms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, therefore you muſt alſo grant that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> means not by the change of nature, the change of the ſubſtance of them, but only the change in the uſe of them, from a common uſe to a holy uſe. And becauſe it may be you will delay to ſubſcribe to the truth of our doctrine, until you hear the ſentence and judgement of the Fathers. Therefore I will ſet them down here. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>contra Marc. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>This is my body, that is, a figure of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Chryſostome</hi> ſaith, <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Cor. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>What is that which the bread ſignifies, the body of Chriſt.

Therefore a Pope, <hi>Gelaſius</hi> by name, ſaith, <hi>de duabus natura in Chriſto: Neither the ſubſtance of the bread, nor nature of the wine, ceaſeth to be any more then they were before; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in their own ſubſtance.</hi> And he calls them there, <hi>An image and reſemblance of the body and blood of Chriſt.</hi> Now tell me, <hi>Master Gilbert,</hi> do not theſe ſpeak as plain as we?

So not only are ye more groſs then the Capernaits, who thought that ſaying hard: but alſo like the barbarous Canibals, who eat the fleſh of man. O blind leaders of the blind, ſhal myce, dogs and ſwine, eat and drink the precious body and blood of Chriſt? Shal they then have eternal life? I think the ears of all Chriſtians will abhor this your doctrine, and their hearts will tremble at it. Theſe abſurdities, together with Scriptures and Fathers againſt the ſame, hath made ſome of your great pillars to ſay, as <hi>Fiſher againſt the captivity of Babylon, That no man can prove by the words of the Goſpel, that any Prieſt in theſe days doth conſecrat the very body and blood of Chriſt.</hi> And others, as <hi>Lindanus Panop. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Caniſius</hi> and <hi>Petrus a Soto ſupra citati.</hi> That <hi>tranſubſtantiation it but a tradition, which hath not the author of it in the Scripture, nor cannot be defended by the ſame.</hi> And others, as <hi>Tonſtal de Sacramentis,</hi> That <hi>it had been better to have left every man to his own conjecture, as they were before the Council of Lateran, then to bring in ſuch a queſtion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have been longſome in this, but yet it ſo behoved me, becauſe it is the foundation of their ſacrifice of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> and their other idolatries and abominations. So then, to conclud this, ſeeing your doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation is agreeable neither to the doctrine of Chriſt, nor his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, nor ancient Fathers, nor your own Canon Law and Popes, as they have been cited: And ſeeing ye are at ſuch variance among your ſelves concerning the ſame, therefore it is to be rejected as heretical, damnable and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106559:98"/> blaſphemous, by all Chriſtians. And this for the fourth point of your doctrine.</p>

                     </note> ſome for another. I will only ſpeak this of it, that it is uſually taken by the ancient Writers, for the diſmiſſion, or skailing, as we call it, of the Church, after the publick ſervice was done to God, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> grants, in the firſt acception of this word <hi>Maſs.</hi> And therefore in the end of your Maſs, the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con crys, <hi>Ite miſſa eſt;</hi> that is, <hi>Go your way, the Congregation is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed.</hi> But now the Papiſts takes not the word in this ſenſe, for the skailing of the Church, or diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the people, after the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of preaching, prayer, and ſo forth: but for that abominable ſacrifice of theirs, wherein, as they ſuppone, they offer up Chriſt his very body and blood in a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the quick and the dead, as <hi>M. Gilbert</hi> doth here. And for this cauſe they call this ſacrifice, the <hi>Maſs,</hi> that is; firſt, <hi>ſent from the Father to us, that Chriſt his body and blood might be with us: next, ſent from us to the Father, that he may interceed, and may be for us with the Father,</hi> as <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus lib.</hi> 4. <hi>ration. divin.</hi> teſtifieth. But how can he be ſent from them to heaven, ſeeing he deſcends in the mouth,

                  <p>Thus much now for the name of the Maſs, which all Chriſtians ſhould abhor, according to that of <hi>David, That he would not take the name of falſe Gods in his mouth, Pſal.</hi> 16 4. For that word which is proponed by men for an Article of our Faith, which is not found in the Scripture, neither in proper terms, nor yet in ſubſtance, and by neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence out of the ſame, ſhould be rejected by the Church of God, as a profane and a baſtard word. But the Maſs is ſuch: For it is proponed by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Faith: and yet it is neither found in proper termes, nor in ſubſtance, nor by any neceſſary conſequence out of the Scripture: Therefore it ſhould be rejected, as profane and idolatrous, by the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>This for the name: Now to the matter. This is one of the greateſt controverſies betwixt you and us, concerning your ſacrifice of the Maſs: which, as ye account it moſt heavenly, ſo we account it moſt abominable, as that which injures the Son of God, which derogats from his death and paſſion, which is injurious to his everlaſting Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which is idolatrous, vain, needleſs, and fruitleſs; which hinders and overthrows the true ſervice of God: all which ſhal be made plain of it, by Gods grace.</p>
                  <p>The matter of our controverſie therefore is: Whither Jeſus Chriſt, God and man, his body and blood be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:106559:100"/> and corporally offered up in your ſacrifice of the Maſs? as ye call it. And whither this your ſacrifice be a propiciatory ſacrifice for the ſins of the quick and the dead? This your Church affirms and holds, and this we deny. Now let us ſee your reaſons firſt, and then we will ſet down what reaſons we have for us out of the Word of God to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>As to yours. Firſt, ye ſay it way prefigured by the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Next, propheſied of by the Prophets. And thirdly, done and inſtituted by Chriſt our Savior, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him to be done to the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt, This ſacrifice was prefigured by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the Old Teſtament, for the which purpoſe ye quote <hi>Levit.</hi> 2. <hi>and</hi> 6.20. Unto the which I anſwer, That the ſacrifices of the Old Teſtament were figures and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of that great and bloody ſacrifice of Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>ones offered up,</hi> upon the croſs, never to be offered up again, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25.26.27.28. and of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſacrifices, and ſervice to God, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaks in theſe places here cited, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15.16. The which alſo were fulfilled in that one and only ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of himſelf upon the croſs, for the ſins of the world; and are fulfilled in our <hi>ſpiritual ſacrifices of our ſelves,</hi> and of the <hi>calves of out lips</hi> continually. But that theſe were figures of your abominable ſacrifice in the Maſs, there is not a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable in the whole Scripture to prove the ſame: For that which was prefigured in the Old Teſtament, was, and is fulfilled in the New Teſtament. But the New Teſtament hath not ſo much as one ſyllable of your ſacrifice of the Maſs: therefore it could not be prefigured in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. For if it were prefigured by the ſacrifices of the Old Teſtament, it behoved either to be one with the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſacrifice of all Chriſtians, or elſe one with the bloody ſacrifice of Chriſt upon the croſs: for only theſe two ſorts of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106559:100"/> ſacrifices are prefigured in the Old Teſtament, &amp; recorded to be fulfilled in the New Teſtament: but your ſacrifice of the Maſs, is one with neither of them: for it is not one with the firſt ſort, for they are ſpiritual, &amp; you will have it external: neither is it one with the other of Chriſts ſacrifice upon the croſs, for there he died, &amp; there he ſhed his blood, and there he ſuffered the torments of Gods wrath, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation for our ſins: and there he ſatisfied the juſtice of God, and merited an everlaſting redemption to us. But in your ſacrifice of the Maſs, your ſelves grants, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he crucified, nor is his blood ſhed, nor ſuffers he the wrath of God for our ſins, <hi>nor ſatisfies properly the juſtice of God for the ſame, nor properly merits remiſſion of our ſins</hi> in the Maſs, <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de miſſa, cap.</hi> 4. therefore it is not one with that ſacrifice of Chriſt upon the croſs. For two ſeveral actions which have two different forms, and are done in divers times and places, for divers ends, cannot be one only, and the ſelf ſame ſacrifice: for it is the form that gives a thing to be, and diſtinguiſhes it from all other things. But Chriſt his offering up of himſelf upon the croſs, and your ſacrifice of the Maſs have different forms, are done in divers places and times, and for diverſe ends, therefore they cannot be both one. Further, if they were both one, then it ſhould follow, that as the ſacrifice of Chriſt upon the croſs is of an infinit valor, ſo the ſacrifice of the Maſs ſhould be of the ſame valor. But <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de miſſa, cap.</hi> 4 <hi>fol.</hi> 740. <hi>That the ſacrifice of the Maſs, is but of a finit valor, and the ſacrifice of the croſs of an infinit valor.</hi> Therefore they cannot be both one and the ſelf ſame ſacrifice: Therefore this ſacrifice of your Maſs, ſeeing it is not one with neither of theſe two ſorts of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, is not prefigured in the Old Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſecond, that it was fore-told by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: It is as true as the former: for all the ſacrifices which
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106559:101"/> were fore-told by the Prophets in the Old Teſtament, are fulfilled in the New Teſtament. But the New Teſtament, as hath been ſaid, makes only mention of theſe two ſorts of ſacrifices, Chriſts on the croſs, and our ſpiritual ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: and not a ſyllable or the ſacrifice of the Maſs: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not fore-told by the Prophets in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As for theſe Scriptures which ye quote, <hi>Malac.</hi> 1.10.11.12. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 19.19.21. <hi>and</hi> 56.7. they ſpeak of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual worſhip of God, and of the ſpiritual ſacrifices, which the Gentils being called, ſhould offer up unto God, under the Goſpel, whereof mention is made in theſe places, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15.16. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>and</hi> 15.16. For either they ſpeak properly and literally, or elſe figuratively. But if you ſay they ſpeak properly of external ſacrifices, then they ſpeak here of that legal and ceremonial worſhip of the Jewes, and ſo theſe places doth not appertain to the New Teſtament. Or, if you will ſay, they ſpeak figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; then, I ſay, they make nothing for your external ſacrifice in the Maſs, which you will have to be a ſacrifice, not figuratively, but properly. So howſoever ye expone them, they can no wayes make for your external ſacrifice in the Maſs. Either therefore muſt ye prove this ſacrifice of your Maſs in the New Teſtament firſt (which ye will never be able to do) or elſe the figures and propheſies in the Old Teſtament, will never prove it, ſeeing there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing either prefigured, or fore-told in the Old Teſtament, but that which in the New Teſtament is fulfilled. Let us ſee therefore what you can alledge for this your ſacrifice in the New Teſtament. You ſay, that Chriſt the chief Prieſt (according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> in this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and according to the order of <hi>Aaron</hi>) upon the croſs inſtituted it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19 <hi>Mark</hi> 14 22. and commanded to be obſerved to the end of the world. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the inſtitution, there are two things to be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106559:101"/> examined, which you have written here. The firſt, that you ſay, that Chriſt, <hi>according to the order of Aaron, did offer up himſelf upon the croſs.</hi> Unto the which I anſwer: firſt, that you gain-ſay here, two great Papiſts, <hi>Alanus</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> whereof the one ſaith, that Chriſt never ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Aaronicè,</hi> that is, according to the order of <hi>Aaron, Alanus de Euchariſt. lib</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. The other ſaith, that Chriſt his ſacrifice upon the croſs, was neither <hi>according to the order of Melchiſedeck, nor yet according to the order of Aaron, Bellarm. de Miſſa, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6 <hi>fol.</hi> 626. And not only he affirmes it, that it is not according to the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but alſo he affirmes, <hi>that this ſhould be certain to all the faithful.</hi> So, if you be of the faithful, and his doctrine be true which the Pope your head hath priviledged to be printed, this ſhould alſo have been certain to you, and ſo you ſhould not have gain-ſaid it. You had need to beware of this, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> to contradict ſo openly the learned Fathers and Maiſters of your Catholick faith; for by this doing, ye will both bewray your ſelves that you have no unity and concord one with another, and alſo ye will bring your ſelf in ſuſpicion with your head, that ye are not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Catholick faith, ſeeing you ſo openly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the maiſters and defenders thereof. Mark this, Reader, what concord theſe men have among themſelves, ſome ſaying one thing, ſome another. Next, I ſay, if you refer this alſo to his perſon, that as this action was according to <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſo himſelf was a Prieſt according to his order, in his ſacrifice. Then I ſay, you both gain-ſay the plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.6.10. <hi>and</hi> 7.11. and alſo the learnedſt of your Church, <hi>Bellar. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de miſſa, cap.</hi> 6. For, ſuppoſe it be true, that this ſacrifice of his upon the croſs, did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh all the ſacrifices of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and put an end unto them, according as he ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed:</hi> Yet he offered up this ſacrifice, not as he was a Prieſt according to <hi>Aaron,</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:106559:102"/> (for he was not a Prieſt according to his order at all) but as he was a Prieſt, according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck:</hi> and therefore the Scripture joyns both together, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.6.7.10. to aſſure us that he offered up himſelf upon the croſs, as he was Prieſt, not according to <hi>Aaron,</hi> but according to <hi>Melchiſedeck.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing is, that you ſay, <hi>Chriſt according to the order of Melchiſedeck in this action,</hi> which you mean the Maſs, <hi>did offer up his body and blood under the formes of bread and wine.</hi> It is true indeed, that Chriſt, according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> is an high-Prieſt, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of <hi>Aaron:</hi> but yet neither is it certain out of the Scripture, that <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> did offer up bread and wine, in an external ſacrifice. For the Scripture ſaith only, <hi>he brought it forth.</hi> For this is the proper ſignification of the Hebrew word <hi>Hotzſi,</hi> as in ſundry places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135. <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. <hi>Num.</hi> 30. and ſo the Chaldaick Paraphraſt, <hi>Amena,</hi> which is, <hi>to bring forth:</hi> and the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; and ſo <hi>Cyprian. Epiſt. ad Caecil. &amp; Chryſoſt hom.</hi> 35. <hi>in cap.</hi> 14. <hi>Geneſ. &amp; Joſeph. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. <hi>&amp; Ambroſ. upon the</hi> 7. <hi>cap. Epiſt. ad Heb. he brought forth for to refreſh Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. And Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> ſaith the ſame upon the 14 of <hi>Gen. There is nothing written there of a ſacrifice or oblation; but a bringing forth of bread and wine to refreſh the victors,</hi> ſaith he, which is not to ſacrifice. And it is certain that he gave it to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his company to refreſh them with, after the ſlaughter of theſe Kings. And the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb</hi> 7 whereas he ſets down theſe things wherein <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was a type of Chriſt, he doth not ſo much as give any inkling of this: For there he compares <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> with Chriſt. Firſt, that as <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was both King and Prieſt, ſo was Chriſt. Next, as <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was without father and mother, beginning and ending, the Scripture not mentioning of it, ſo was Chriſt. Thirdly,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106559:102"/> as <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was greater then <hi>Aaron,</hi> and had a more excellent Prieſthood then the Levitical Prieſthood, ſo was Chriſts. But never a word here of a ſacrifice of bread and wine, wherein <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> ſhould have reſembled the ſacrifice of your Maſs, as ye ſuppoſe. So you find out here, that which the Spirit of God found not out: and ſo ye make your ſelf wiſer then the holy Ghoſt in his Epiſtle. But we will learn not to be <hi>wiſe above that which is written,</hi> and to ſearch no further then the Spirit of God hath found out already. And ſuppoſe it were granted to you (which ye are never able to prove) that <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> did offer up bread and wine, yet what to do hath this with your deviliſh abomination of your Maſs, wherein ye ſay the ſubſtance of bread and wine is gone away, only the formes remaining. For if your ſacrifice in the Maſs be like the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> then the ſubſtance of bread and wine ſhould remain, as it did in the ſacrifice of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck,</hi> and the bread and wine ſhould be offered up, and not Chriſts body and blood, as bread and wine only were offered up in <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> his ſacrifice. So then, either <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> his ſacrifice is not a type of your ſacrifice in the Maſs, or elſe true bread and wine remains in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and not Chriſt his body and blood which is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up. Chooſe you then, whither you will deny your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to be according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> or elſe will you let go your real preſence, your tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and your perſonal offering up of Chriſt Jeſus in your abominable Maſs, for one you muſt do.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if Chriſt offered up ſuch a ſacrifice at his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as was prefigured by <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> which you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm here, then muſt it follow that Chriſt fulfilled that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure perfectly; and ſo the ſame ſacrifice needs no more to be offered up again, and ſo here will follow the deſolation of your Maſs-Prieſts, whoſe work is chiefly in repeating of this ſacrifice again.</p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:106559:103"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, I would ask you, whither is this ſacrifice which ye ſay he offered up according to the order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeck</hi> in his laſt Supper, one with that ſacrifice which he offered up upon the croſs, or not? If it be one, then I ſay as he died and ſhed his blood on the croſs, and purchaſed an everlaſting redemption by the ſame: ſo this ſacrifice of your Maſs muſt be joyned with his death, and ſhedding of his blood, and muſt have the like vertue and effect to redeem us, and ſo two abſurdities will follow. The one, that Chriſt not only ſhould twiſe have died, once in the Supper, and afterward upon the croſs: but alſo dies, and is crucified continually, in your Maſs, and yet the Scripture ſaith, he died but once. The other, that that ſacrifice of his upon the croſs is ſuperfluous: for what needed him to die again to redeem mankind, ſince the firſt offering of himſelf in the Supper was a ſufficient redemption? For if his ſacrifice upon the croſs was a ſufficient redemption, which you cannot deny: and if the ſacrifice of him in the Supper be one with that, of neceſſity it muſt follow, that as his ſacrifice upon the croſs was a ſufficient redemption: even ſo his ſacrifice in the Supper muſt be a ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for mankind. And therefore <hi>Alanus,</hi> a great defender of your Catholick faith, ſaith, according to the judgement of the Council of <hi>Trent, That the new Covenant is founded on the blood of Chriſt offered up in the Supper, before he was crucified: and that Chriſt was truly our paſſover the day before he ſuffered:</hi> and he ſaith, <hi>This is the foundation of all Christian doctrine, according to the judgement of the Council, Alanus de Euchar. lib.</hi> 2 <hi>cap.</hi> 28. Now if this be true, that he was our Paſſover, before he died, and the covenant was founded in his blood which he offered up in the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: then, certainly, Chriſt died in vain, which is more then blaſphemous: and ſo blaſphemous muſt that doctrine of your Maſs be, which carries with it ſuch a blaſphemie.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106559:103"/> And if you will ſay, it is not the ſame with that ſacrifice upon the croſs: then, I ſay, Firſt, you are contrary to your own Church in this, who ſaith, it is one with that ſacrifice of the croſs. Next, Chriſt his body and blood is not offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then in the Supper: for his body and blood was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up upon the croſs, and ſo your Maſs is gone, or elſe make two Chriſts, one in the Supper under the forms of bread and wine, which the Diſciples ſaw not: and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who was offered up upon the croſs, which was ſeen of all. So whither will ye go, and unto what ſide will ye turn you, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> for the uphold of your Maſs? For there are rocks and ſand-beds on every ſide. So neither did Chriſt offer up himſelf in a ſacrifice at all in his laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, neither did he it according to the order of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck.</hi> But now let us ſee how ye prove this ſacrifice out of the inſtitution. And ſeeing this point of doctrine is ſuch a weighty point, as whereupon the ſalvation and damnation of ſouls doth hing: therefore, I pray thee, Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, deceive not thine own ſoul to thy everlaſting perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but take good heed what ground is in the inſtitution for this their ſacrifice; for if they prove it not here, it will never be proved by the Scripture. You ſay therefore, that <hi>Christ took bread and wine;</hi> we grant that, yet here is no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. What then? <hi>He gave thanks:</hi> yet here is no ſacrifice. What next? <hi>He bleſſed it.</hi> Yet here is no ſacrifice. And whereas ye ſay, that by this bleſſing, and his heavenly words, the bread and wine is changed in the body and blood of Chriſt: that I have ſufficiently (as I hope) over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown already. But to return to the words of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: after the bleſſing of the bread, which <hi>Luke</hi> expones <hi>by giving of thanks:</hi> the text ſaith, <hi>He gave.</hi> What gave he but that which he took, and had bleſſed? And what took he, and bleſſed he but the bread? And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>The bread which we bleſs,</hi> &amp;c. So
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106559:104"/> then it was bread which he gave, and not his own body and blood corporally. And unto whom gave he it? The text ſaith, <hi>unto his diſciples,</hi> both in <hi>Matthew, Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> all with one conſent. Now that which was given to his Diſciples, was not properly offered up in a ſacrifice: for a ſacrifice is an offering to God. And the text ſaith here, <hi>He gave it to his Diſciples.</hi> So there is not a ſyllable in the inſtitution, that can make for your pretended ſacrifice. You here corrupt the word of Jeſus Chriſt wonderfully: For firſt, you expone by <hi>giving, offering up in a ſacrifice.</hi> Next, whereas the Scripture in <hi>Matthew, Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> have but <hi>giving</hi> once, &amp; refers this <hi>giving,</hi> not to God, but to the Diſciples: <hi>And he gave it to the Diſciples:</hi> you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge here <hi>two givings:</hi> the one to God, which is your own invention, whereof the Scripture makes no mention: the other to the Diſciples, which is the form of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not of a ſacrifice: for a Sacrament is given to us, a ſacrifice to God. So all the grounds of your ſacrifice of the Maſs is two: the one is, your deviſed tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo one error leans upon another: the other is, not the words of Chriſt, <hi>And he gave it to his Diſciples,</hi> but your own words, and your own expoſition only, <hi>And he gave, or offered up himſelf then for them.</hi> Theſe are your own words, and not the words of the holy Ghoſt. So this ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of your Maſs, hath not the words of Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Matthew, Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> have ſet them down, to be the ground of it: but only your own words, and your own interpretation. For how dare ye be ſo impudent as to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that Chriſt gave it twiſe: once in an offering for his Diſciples, and another time in a Sacrament to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſeeing we will believe <hi>Matthew, Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> the ſworn pen-men of the holy Ghoſt, who ſay only he gave it to his Diſciples as a Sacrament, and makes no mention at all that he gave it to God as a ſacrifice. Do you think
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106559:104"/> the Lord will never take an account of you for ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt lie of the Son of God, of his Scripture, of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and holy Writers who writ it, they all ſaying, <hi>He gave it to his Diſciples;</hi> and you affirming beſide that giving to them, that <hi>he gave it,</hi> that is, <hi>offered it up for them?</hi> O ſinful man! Who will venter the ſalvation of his ſoul upon ſo ſmal a threed; yea, upon ſo impudent a lie, as ye make of the Son of God. O repent, or elſe you ſhal one day feel the fierceneſs of the Lords hot wrath and indignation upon your ſoul and carcaſs for evermore. Leave off therefore to be the cauſe of the damnation of ſouls, for you deceive them, and makes them believe that this monſtrous abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of your Maſs, hath Jeſus Chriſt to be the Author of it, while it hath not ſo much as a ſyllable in the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution that gives ſo much as an inkling of it. Are you wiſer then the wiſeſt of your generation: <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who for all the arguments that he brings, never ſo much as once gives an inkling of this your argument. For he thought it was too plain a lie to affirm a double giving here out of the words of the inſtitution: and too abſurd an expoſition to expone, <hi>He gave,</hi> that is, <hi>he offered it up.</hi> And therefore he hath no ſuch reaſoning for his ſacrifice of the Maſs. Yea, that which ye think is plain out of the inſtitution, that Chriſt offered up his body and his blood in the Supper, he ſaith, <hi>That the action of offering cannot be eaſily diſtinguiſhed and ſeparated from the other actions which was done joyntly there together by the words of the institution, Bellar. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de miſſa, cap.</hi> 12. <hi>fol.</hi> 669. And more plainly, he ſaith, <hi>That the Evangeliſts have not expreſly ſaid, that Chriſt offered up himſelf unto the Father in the Supper, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de miſſa, cap.</hi> 24. <hi>fol.</hi> 706. This is a plain ſpeaking. Now your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs hath no expreſs warrant out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt, if you will believe him, whoſe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies are allowed by the Pope to be printed. But it may
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:106559:105"/> be ye thought that this your doctrine would have been ſwallowed up without further tryal, &amp; therefore you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not what you writ. You have ſtoln your ſelf in ſuch credit with the ſimple among you, who are deceived and blinded by your lies, that ye are not aſhamed to be plain enough in ſpeaking untruths &amp; lies of the Word of God. But the Lord will reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence this one day. But now to return to the reſt of the words of the inſtitution, as ye rehearſe them. And laſt of all, ye ſay, <hi>He gave his body and blood to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to be eaten</hi> He gave it ſpiritually, and they did eat it ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually: and he gave them Sacraments of his body and blood, the bread and wine corporally to them, and they did eat them corporally, ſuppoſe for a ſpiritual uſe and end. For that which he gave, they did eat: he gave the bread and wine, therefore it was bread and wine which they did eat and drink. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith plainly, <hi>For whoſoever ſhal eat of this bread, &amp;c.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. He calls it bread that is eaten. And our Savior ſaith, <hi>Verily, verily, from henceforth ſhal I not drink of the fruit of this vine with you, Matth.</hi> 26.29. That which he gave his Apoſtles to drink corporally in the latter Supper, was the fruit of the vine, ſo the Evangeliſts ſaith. But Chriſts blood was not the fruit of the vine: therefore it was not his his blood which they corporally drank, but wine, which was the fruit of the vine-tree. I go forward. And when he had done this, ye ſay, <hi>He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded his Diſciples,</hi> that is, <hi>the lawful Paſtors of the Church to do the ſame for the remembrance of him to the end of the world.</hi> That is true, that which he did here, he commanded to be done by his Diſciples to the end of the world: but never a ſyllable here that he offered up his body and blood under the forms of bread and wine in the Supper, in a propiciatory ſacrifice for the quick and the dead: Therefore he commanded not this ſacrifice of your Maſs to be done to the end of the world. And
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:106559:105"/> whereas ye reſtrict this commandment, <hi>Do this,</hi> only to the Paſtors, ye have to underſtand that as there is ſomething here which Chriſt did, which is proper to them, as to be the diſpenſers of theſe heavenly myſteries; ſo there is ſome actions here, which is common alſo with them to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as to receive, to eat, to drink theſe Sacraments of his body and blood in his remembrance. Seeing therefore this commandment, <hi>Do this,</hi> is to be referred to the whole actions of the Supper: &amp; ſeeing there is ſome actions in the ſame, which the other Chriſtians ſhould do alſo: therefore this commandment, <hi>Do this,</hi> is not to be reſtricted to the office of the Paſtors only, (which ye do) but common with them to the actions of the people. Now to your conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Seeing, ſay ye, your Prieſts do the ſame in this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which our Savior did: how can I ſay that your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in this, was not inſtituted by Chriſt. If you do the ſame that he did, indeed I will grant you it. But ye do not the ſame which our Savior did: Therefore your Religion in this is not inſtituted by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The which I prove. Firſt, Chriſt took bread and wine in this Sacrament, and gave it to be eaten and drunken; and bread was eaten, and wine was drunken by his Diſciples. But your Prieſt takes bread and wine, and conjures the ſubſtance Of it away by your tranſubſtantiation, and only remains the forms of the bread and wine behind: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you do not the thing which Chriſt did.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt took bread and brake it: you take bread, and hangs it up, and keeps it in a box, to carry to the ſick, and in proceſſions. Thirdly, Chriſt took bread and gave it to his Apoſtles: your Prieſts like gluttons in the ſacrifice of your Maſs, eats it up every whit himſelf alone. Fourthly, Chriſt gave a Sacrament to ſtrengthen mens faith: but your Prieſts gives a ſacrifice to redeem mens ſouls. Fifthly, Chriſt gave it to be eaten, your Prieſts
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:106559:106"/> gives it to be worſhipped. Sixthly, Chriſt gave bread: your Prieſts ſay they give God. Seventhly, Chriſt gave the cup to his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>Drink ye all of this:</hi> your Prieſt drinks all himſelf, and takes away the cup from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, both in your ſacrifice and Sacrament. Eightly, Chriſt inſtituted the Supper, and commanded the Church to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrat the ſame, as he had inſtituted it: but the Maſs hath been clamped up by many ſundry Popes: one made the <hi>Confiteor,</hi> another the <hi>Introit,</hi> another the <hi>Kyrieeleiſon,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Gloria in excelſis</hi> and ſo forth of the reſt, as ſhal be proved afterward. Ninthly, Chriſt intending to celebrat his Supper, changeth not his garment: but the Prieſt going to ſay his Maſs, doth nought but clothe and unclothe, and every garment carrying a great myſtery. The Prieſt ſaying Maſs, muſt have his head and beard ſhaven, and upon his head a circle of hair, which they call a crown; imitating the Prieſts of the Gentils in this, <hi>Baruch chap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 30. and not Chriſt, and his Apoſtles. Tenthly, Chriſt in the Supper uſed common bread: but the Popiſh Prieſt muſt expreſly uſe other manner of bread, baken betwixt two irons, which is properly, Wafers. Eleventhly, Chriſt made his Supper upon a table: the Popiſh Prieſt muſt have a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat Altar, with ſome pieces of relicks put in the hole of it; or elſe a marble ſtone, in the borders whereof are little pieces of cloth, which they call <hi>Corporales,</hi> to ſay his Maſs on. Twefthly, Chriſt in the celebrating of the Supper, preached and taught his Apoſtles: the Popiſh Prieſt mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth betwixt his teeth certain prayers: he turneth to and from the Altar, one while his back, another while his face to the people: now goeth he from one ſide of the Altar unto another: now he ſingeth with an high voice, now with a low voice: now he lifts up his arms, now he caſteth them down. Briefly, he ſeemeth to be a man wholly mad, not knowing what countenance for to uſe. Thirteenthly,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106559:106"/> Chriſt in the Supper ſpake in a vulgar tongue, that all might underſtand: the Popiſh Prieſt in their Maſſes ſpeaks in a ſtrange tongue, which the moſt part of themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not. Fourteenthly, Chriſt firſt brake the bread. and then gave it to his Apoſtles: the profane Prieſt firſt ſpeaketh certain words over the bread in his Maſs, and then breaketh it (or the accidents of it, as they ſay) at their pleaſure. Fifteenthly, Chriſt after he had broken the bread, ſaith, <hi>This is my body:</hi> the Popiſh Prieſt ſpeaks the words, without breaking of the bread; and not content with the words of Chriſt, he addeth this word <hi>enim,</hi> unto them. Therefore you cannot, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> but ſpeak againſt the light of your own conſcience, when you ſay that your Prieſts doth the ſame in their Maſs, that Chriſt did in the Supper: And here I appeal your conſcience before the terrible and everliving God, and before Jeſus Chriſt; that ſhal judge the quick and the dead, whither ye do not ſpeak in this againſt the light of your own conſcience, or not? And whether your Prieſts in your Maſs, do the ſame which Chriſt did in the Supper, or not? Think you not that you muſt ſtand before the living God, and give a rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of theſe things? Repent in time, and ceaſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſouls of your Countrey-men any more. But to conclud this: What ado hath your Maſs with the Supper of Chriſt? What likeneſs is there between the one and the other? In the Supper which Chriſt inſtituted in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we are remembred of his death and paſſion upon the croſs, whereby he appeaſed the wrath of God for our ſins, and of our duty towards him; whereby we acknowledge in our conſciences that we are obliged to die to ſin, ſeeing it behoved the eternal Son of God, by his death upon the croſs, to redeem us from the ſame: upon the which ariſes an earneſt thankſgiving in the hearts and mouthes of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true Chriſtian, for ſo great a ſalvation, purchaſed ſo
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106559:107"/> wonderfully, as by the death of the eternal Son of God. In your ſacrifice of the Maſs, is there any ſuch thing? Is there any remembrance of his death &amp; ſuffering there? Is his death ſhown to the people in a known language, that they may underſtand it? Is there any acknowledging of any duty there for his death? Is there any true thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving there? No, none. But in ſtead of theſe, a heap of words in an unknown language, and a diverſity of apiſh geſtures, and Moriſh and Juglers tricks, to feed the eyes of the poor people, which neither the people, nor yet many of your ſelves do underſtand. In the Supper we are alſo admoniſhed of our ſpiritual conjunction with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, and of our duty towards him, in that we are all parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of one bread made of many grains, and of one wine made of many grapes; to ſignifie unto us that we are all renewed and redeemed by one blood, members of one body, living by one Spirit, drawing life, motion and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, all from one Head, being one with him, and ſo one with others, whereby follows our mutual duties one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another. In your Maſs there is no communion of the bread made of many grains, and of the wine made of many grapes, to ſignifie this conjunction and communion, either with Chriſt our Head, or among our ſelves, the Prieſt eating and drinking all himſelf. In the Supper, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſt his inſtitution, by giving, taking, eating, and drinking of the bread and wine by all the Diſciples, whereby our bodily life is nowriſhed and ſtrengthened, is not only ſignified and repreſented our ſpiritual growth in that ſpiritual communion with him, whereon our ſpiritual life depends: but alſo in the ſame, all the faithful doth truly by faith eat and drink ſpiritually his fleſh and blood, whereby they are made one with himſelf, fleſh of his fleſh, &amp; bone of his bones, whereby they are ſtrengthned in that ſpiritual life, and confirmed in the hope of that glory. But
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:106559:107"/> is there any ſuch thing in your Papiſtical ſacrifice? Is there any giving and taking, eating and drinking, of bread and wine by the faithful, either to repreſent our communion with Chriſt, &amp; among our ſelves, or to ſtrengthen us in that ſpiritual life through his conjunction? Do the poor people eat or drink, either bodily, or ſpiritually in your Maſs? Is there any action there to ſtir up their conſcience? Or any inſtruction to increaſe their knowledge? Are they ought but idle beholders of a pretended myſtery, which is both dumb and deaf, and of a Prieſt that eats and drinks all him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone? So that in ſtead of theſe heavenly diſhes, which our loving Father doth propine unto us, upon his table in the Supper, what is there in your abominable ſacrifices, but a feeding with husks, an apiſh game, and Juglers tricks, to feed the fantaſies of the poor people, that ſees but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not; that hears, but they know not what. So that in truth there is as great likeneſs betwixt Chriſts Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and your Maſs, as is between the table of the Lord, and the table of Devils, and light with darkneſs. Seeing therefore there is ſuch a difference betwixt your ſacrifice in the Maſs, and Chriſt his Supper, as hath been ſeen: therefore your Prieſts doth not the ſame in the Maſs, which our Savior did in the laſt Supper. And therefore how can ye ſay, that your Religion in this is inſtituted by Chriſt? And this is ſo evident, that ſome of your own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and learned Writers, have been forced to confeſs the ſame. As <hi>Petrus a Soto</hi> in his book againſt <hi>Brentius,</hi> and <hi>Lindanus, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Panopl.</hi> confeſſes, that the ſacrifice of the Maſs, with many other points of their Religion, <hi>is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written tradition, which hath neither the beginning nor author of it in the Scriptures of God.</hi> And <hi>Gerſon</hi> a Papiſt, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Maſs, ſaith, <hi>in Floretum, that the office of the Maſs was ordained by Saint James and Baſile the Biſhop of Ceſarea; but the Sacrament of the Supper was inſtituted by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:106559:108"/> And he alledges the Canon Law, <hi>De conſ. diſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Canon Jacobus,</hi> for him. So firſt there is three hundred years betwixt <hi>Baſile</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> which are the compoſers of the Maſs. Secondly, he diſtinguiſhes betwixt the Supper and the Maſs, and he ſaith, <hi>The Supper is instituted by Christ, and the office of the Maſs by S. James and S. Baſile.</hi> So if he ſpeak true, the Maſs and the Supper, is not both one; and the Maſs is not inſtituted by Chriſt, as the Supper is. And ſo out of your own mouthes, your Maſs is confeſſed not to be inſtituted by Chriſt in the Scripture. Shameleſs therefore and impudent, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> are ye in affirming that your Religion in this is inſtituted by Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>There are five chief things wherein the inſtruction of Jeſus Chriſt conſiſts, as I have ſhewed before.

Thirdly, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Fourthly, giving, or offering. Fifthly, communicating. Firſt, a lawful Miniſter, as after I ſhal ſhow. Secondly, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the bread &amp; wine, which they have blotted out of their <hi>Scots</hi> Bibles, and put in thankſgiving for the ſame, as if both were one: not the leſs, that both the <hi>Greck</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> is againſt them, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies two diverſe actions, both done and ſaid in <hi>S.

And thirdly, giving or offering of his bleſſed body and blood to his Father for his faithful, which properly is to ſacrifice, as the holy Fathers writes upon the ſame. And as for their thankſgiving, it is but an invention of their own head, as may be ſeen in their Pſalm books: and their communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is but of bread and wine, but ours is of the body and blood of Chriſt.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:106559:108"/> of Chriſt conſiſts; to wit, a lawful Miniſter. 2. Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. 3. Bleſſing. 4 Giving, or offering. 5 Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. We grant that a lawful Miniſter is required, but not a ſacrificing Prieſt here, becauſe there is no external and outward ſacrifice here, as ye ſuppone, and as hath been proved. And ſeeing your Prieſts are ſacrificing Prieſts, of a ſacrifice that hath not a ſyllable in the Word of God to bear witneſs unto it, and ſeeing their authority depends of the authority of the Pope, which in Antichriſtian, as ſhal be proved hereafter: and ſeeing the moſt part of your Prieſts are admitted without the due tryal and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of gifts and manners, and the moſt part cannot preach the Goſpel, as experience teacheth; therefore in your communion, or rather abominable ſacrifice of your Maſs, (for how can it be called a Communion, where the Prieſt only eats and drinks up all?) there is no lawful Miniſter: and ſeeing our offices is lawful; to wit, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel, the adminiſtration of Sacraments, and Diſcipline: and ſeeing our entry to the offices is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful alſo, by due examination of life and doctrine: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the authority of our calling is from God, who enables whom he calls with gifts meet to diſcharge the calling, and from his Church, examining, trying, teſtifying, approving, ordaining, and conſenting unto the ſame: Therefore in the adminiſtration of our Communion, there are lawful Miniſters. As to the ſecond, thankſgiving; we grant alſo it is compriſed in the inſtitution of Chriſt his Sacrament, and is required in the celebration of the ſame: But you ſay, our thankſgiving which we uſe, is but an invention of our own heads, as may be ſeen in our Pſalm books. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I anſwer: If ye reſpect the matter contained in our thankſgiving, it hath the warrant of the Scripture, and ſo in that reſpect it is not our own invention. If ye reſpect the authority, we are taught and commanded by our Savior,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106559:109"/> both by his example, for he <hi>gave thanks:</hi> and alſo by his commandment, <hi>Do this,</hi> to do the ſame. And ſo in that reſpect it is not our own invention. If you reſpect the end, it is Gods glory, which is the proper end of all thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. If ye will reſpect the form of this thankſgiving; to wit, the words and order wherein it is conceived: I ſay, it is left indifferent to the Church of God to form their prayers and thankſgiving; ſo being the matter, end, and authority of the uſing of them publickly, have their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant out of the Word of God So ſeeing the authority to give thanks, and the matter alſo of our thankſgiving, and end thereof is ſet down in the Word; and ſeeing the Lord hath left it free to the Church of God, concerning the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form of the ſame, the Scriptures not determining it, which your ſelf, I hope, will not deny. For your Canon hath many forms of prayers, and thankſgiving in your Maſs, which after that form and order is not ſet down in the Word of God. Therefore, you injury the Lords Spirit and his Church, who calls our thankſgiving our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
                  <p>As to the third concerning <hi>bleſſing,</hi> which you diſtinguiſh from thankſgiving, and ſaith, we have blotted it out of our <hi>Scots</hi> Bibles, and put thankſgiving in the room there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and ſo you ſay, we want that part. Firſt then, I will ask you, Did not <hi>Luke</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſet down the whole form and the chief points of the inſtitution of that Sacrament? I ſuppoſe you will not deny it, for it were too plain an impiety for you to ſay, that either <hi>Luke,</hi> the ſworn pen-man of Gods Spirit, or <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>I have received of the Lord, that which alſo I have delivered unto you,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. that either of theſe had omitted the hiſtory of the inſtitution of this Sacrament, a principal point thereof: but either this <hi>bleſſing</hi> is one with <hi>thanksgiving,</hi> or elſe they have omitted a principal point thereof, for neither of them
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:106559:109"/> makes mention in theſe places of <hi>bleſſing,</hi> but only of <hi>thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving:</hi> therefore it is one with thankſgiving.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſay, either the whole three Evangeliſts, and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in ſetting down the inſtitution of the Sacrament of the Supper, omits a chief thing: to wit, the <hi>bleſſing of the cup</hi> (which I ſuppoſe ye will not ſay) or elſe the bleſſing of the cup is one with thankſgiving: for the Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Luke</hi> makes no mention at all of bleſſing, but only of thankſgiving: and the two Evangeliſts <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> makes no mention of the bleſſing of the cup: but ſaith, <hi>that after,</hi> or <hi>alſo he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, &amp;c.</hi> therefore they are one.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if ye will credit one Evangeliſt exponing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereas <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> have this word, <hi>and he bleſſed: Luke</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> have theſe words, <hi>And he gave thanks.</hi> And whereas <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> have this word, <hi>bleſſing,</hi> after he took the bread, they uſe the word <hi>thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,</hi> after he took the cup, to ſignifie that they are both one. And therefore if ye will believe Scripture exponing Scripture, they are both one. Yea, what will you ſay to <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de ſacram. Euchar. cap.</hi> 10 <hi>That ſome Catholicks contends, that both the words (to bleſs) and to (give thanks) in the Scripture, ſignifies one thing?</hi> and therefore they interpret <hi>thanksgiving, bleſſing.</hi> So if you will credit your own Catholicks, they are both one here.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you ſay, that both in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> they ſignifie diverſe things. I anſwer: Indeed it is true that ſometimes they ſignifie diverſe actions; as <hi>bleſſing, Numb.</hi> 6. for the petition of a bleſſing. But yet ſometimes alſo, bleſſing is taken in the Scripture for thankſgiving, as both I have proved in theſe places; as alſo, if ye will deny, there is many places in the Scripture for the contrary, as <hi>Luke</hi> 1.65. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. And whereas you ſay, that in <hi>Mark</hi> they ſignifie two diſtinct actions, I have
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106559:110"/> proved before, they are both one.</p>
                  <p>And laſt of all, I ſay if by bleſſing you mean the words of the conſecration, <hi>this is my body which is broken for you, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> affirms, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de ſacram Euch. cap.</hi> 13 that the <hi>Roman catechiſt ſo expones it,</hi> and the Theologues commonly teaches the ſame: then I ſay, we want not that chief point, for we rehearſe the words of the inſtitution. So howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the word <hi>(bleſſing)</hi> be taken, either for thankſgiving, or for the ſanctification of theſe elements to an holy uſe, by prayer, which is comprehended in the thankſgiving, or for the words (as ye call them) of the conſecration, we have always this bleſſing in our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion. And as for your hovering and blowing of the words of Chriſt over the bread and calice, with your croſſing and charming them, after the manner of Sorcerers, with a ſet number and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of words and ſigns, your hiding it, your rubbing of your fingers for fear of crums, your firſt thortering, and then lifting up of your arms, your joining and disjoyning of thumb and fore-finger, and ſundry other vain and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous ceremonies and curioſities, which you uſe in bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the elements, they have neither command, nor example of Chriſts inſtitution and action, and the Apoſtles doctrine and doing in the Scriptures of God.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the fourth, <hi>giving, or offering</hi> up of the body and blood of Chriſt to his Father, by the faithful: We confeſs a giving to his Diſciples, which you call afterward a communicating. But for another giving, that is (as you expone it) an offering up of his body and blood to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we utterly deny it, as a thing not ſo much as once mentioned in the whole inſtitution, but contrary to the ſame, and Antichriſtian: and therefore we utterly abhor it, and deteſt it, as an invention of your own, as Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as idolatry, as abomination, as that which derogates from that bleſſed &amp; only one ſacrifice, whereby he offered
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106559:110"/> up himſelf once upon the croſs, never to be offered up again, as the Scripture teſtifies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 25. And <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith plainly, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de miſſa, cap.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 24. That this <hi>offering up is not expreſly ſet down in the words of the institution, and that it cannot be eaſily diſcerned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for the fifth, a <hi>communicating,</hi> we have it, and that not only of the bread and wine, as ye here imagine, but of Jeſus Chriſt, God and Man, his very fleſh and blood, and all his bleſſings by faith ſpiritually: ſeeing therefore we have all theſe points which are requiſit in the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a lawful Miniſter, thankſgiving, bleſſing, giving, and communicating: therefore we have the true inſtitution of Chriſt in the Sacrament. And becauſe in this your abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſacrifice of the Maſs (as hath been ſaid) there is no communion: For the Prieſt takes all: And becauſe you affirm the perſonal and corporal preſence of Chriſts fleſh and blood in your ſacrifice, and the corporal eating and drinking of it, which is Capernaitical and more then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, contrary to the Scripture, contrary the nature of a Sacrament, contrary the truth of Chriſt his humanity, and contrary the Articles of our Faith, of his aſcenſion, ſitting at his right hand, and there remaining, till his returning in the laſt day: all which your ſacrifice of the Maſs, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation in your communion overthroweth: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have not the true inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>I might end here, but becauſe ye account the ſacrifice of your Maſs moſt heavenly, and the principal part of the worſhip of God. and we account it a moſt abominable idolatry: therefore I will ſet down ſome arguments againſt the ſame; whereby, if you will, you may perceive the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſay, all lawful ſacrifices have the expreſs teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Scripture to warrant the inſtitution of them to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:106559:111"/> be of God. But your ſacrifice of the Maſs hath no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs teſtimony of the Scripture, whereby it may be made manifeſt that it is inſtituted of God: therefore it is not lawful, What now will you ſay to this? The propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you cannot deny, for our Savior ſaith, <hi>In vain worſhip ye me teaching for doctrine mens commandments, Matth.</hi> 15.9. And <hi>Jeremie</hi> reproves the Jewes, <hi>that they would not walk according as the Lord commanded them, but according to their own will, Jer.</hi> 7 24. And the Apoſtle condemns <hi>all voluntary Religion, Col.</hi> 2.23. Therefore this is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that that Religion or ſacrifice which hath not expreſs Scripture, whereby it may be made plain that it is inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, is not lawful: For <hi>all that is done without faith, is ſin, Rom.</hi> 14.23. and <hi>faith hath only the Word of God to lean to, Rom.</hi> 10.17. And dare the creature be ſo bold as to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a mean to worſhip God, without the warrant of his will in his Word? Now to the aſſumption, what can you ſay to it? Bring me an expreſs teſtimony out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that God hath inſtituted your Maſs, and take it to you. Yea, if it be inſtituted in any place of the Scripture, it is inſtituted in the laſt Supper (for this you grant your ſelves:) But there is not a ſyllable in the whole inſtitution, that Chriſt offered up himſelf in a ſacrifice in the ſame, as hath been proved: and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> the learnedeſt of your Church confeſſes plainly, that the <hi>Evangeliſts have not ſaid expreſly that Christ offered up himſelf in the Supper in a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Bellarm. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de miſſa, cap.</hi> 24. And therefore others of your own Religion, <hi>Petrus a Soto,</hi> in his book againſt <hi>Brentius, Lindanus lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Panopliae,</hi> Papiſts of great name, have reckoned the ſacrifice of the Maſs among <hi>the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have not their beginning nor author in the Scriptures.</hi> So then by your own confeſſion, the ſacrifice of the Maſs hath not expreſs Scripture to warrant it: yea, it is a tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which hath neither the beginning nor author of it in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106559:111"/> the Scriptures of God. And I would ask this queſtion of you: What can be the cauſe wherefore the typical ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and all the rites and ceremonies thereof, is ſo expreſly ſet down in the Scripture of the Old Teſtament (which you will not deny) and this ſacrifice of yours, which ye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count more excellent then all theſe, not to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſet down in the New Teſtament, neither the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, nor the rites and ceremonies thereof, yea not ſo much as the very name of it? Is the New Teſtament, think ye, more obſcure then the Old Teſtament? which is abſurd to ſay. Shal the Old Teſtament be clear in ſetting down the ſacrifices, and all the rites thereof, which is but the ſhadow? And ſhould not the New Teſtament have been at the leaſt, as clear in ſetting down the ſacrifice of the New Teſtament, which ye affirm to be the Maſs, if it were ſuch? What an abſurd thing is this? Chriſtian Reader, aſſure thy ſelf, the Lord Jeſus would have dealt as loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly with thee, in ſetting down the ſacrifice of the Maſs in the New Teſtament (if ever he had inſtituted ſuch a ſacrifice) as he was in ſetting down the ſacrifices of the Old Teſtament. But thou may aſſure thy ſelf, and thy conſcience may lean unto it, ſince he hath not ſo much as once expreſſed it in all the New Teſtament, therefore he hath never appointed it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſay, in all the places of Scripture whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Apoſtles ſpeaks of the ſacrifices which Chriſtians ſhould offer up, they ever ſpeak of ſpiritual ſacrifices, and never ſpeak of this external ſacrifice of the Maſs. They never remember of this their ſacrifice of the offering up of Chriſt in the Maſs. Look throughout the whole New Teſtament, and thou ſhalt not find this, as namely in theſe places, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. Are you and your Maſs Prieſts more wiſe then the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are? Whither ſhould we then think and ſpeak as they
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106559:112"/> ſpake and thought, or as ye would have us? They never ſpake of your ſacrifice of the Maſs, and bring one inſtance, if ye can: therefore neither ſhould we. We will believe them rather then you.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that doctrine which is expreſly gain-ſaid by the Scripture, muſt be falſe: This you cannot deny. But this your doctrine concerning the often and dayly offering up of Jeſus Chriſt his body and blood in ſacrifice in your Maſs, is expreſly gain-ſaid by the Scripture: For the Scripture ſaith in ſundry places, That <hi>he hath once offered up himſelf,</hi> never to offer up himſelf again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>By the which will we are ſanctified, even by the offering up of Jeſus Christ once made.</hi> 11. <hi>And every Prieſt ſtandeth dayly mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring, and oft times offereth one manner of offering, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take away ſin.</hi> 12. <hi>But this man, after he had offered one ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſin, ſitteth for ever at the right hand of God.</hi> 10. <hi>For with one offering hath he conſecrated for ever them that are ſanctified. Heb.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Chriſt hath entred into the very heaven, to appear now in the ſight of God for us; not that he ſhould offer himſelf often, &amp;c.</hi> 28. <hi>So Chriſt was once offered to take away the ſins of many. Heb.</hi> 7.27. <hi>Chriſt died once, when he offered up himſelf.</hi> Seeing the Scripture therefore affirms ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Chriſt <hi>once offered up himſelf,</hi> and you affirm that in your abominable ſacrifice he offers up himſelf often, ſince the Scripture ſaith, the offering up of Chriſt is <hi>once only,</hi> &amp; ye ſay it is often in your Maſs: therefore this doctrine of yours is plain againſt the expreſs ſayings of the Scripture. For ſuppoſe ye will have an unbloody offering up of Chriſt, yet the Scripture only acknowledges this bloody offering up of himſelf upon the croſs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I will ask you, to what purpoſe ſerves the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſacrifice of Chriſt in your Maſs? It muſt be for one of two; to wit, either to ſatisfie for our ſins, (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye call it a propiciatory ſacrifice) or elſe to apply that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:106559:112"/> ſatisfaction once made by his death upon the croſs unto us, the which ye affirm alſo of it: But for neither of theſe is Jeſus Chriſt to be offered up again: therefore for no cauſe is he to be ſacrificed in your Maſs. Not for the firſt, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for our ſins, becauſe the Scripture ſaith plainly, that he hath ſatisfied for our ſins, by his once oblation upon the croſs, never to die again, and therefore our Savior ſaith upon the croſs, <hi>It is finiſhed.</hi> And our redemption and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is aſcribed only to his death once made, and his blood once ſhed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. <hi>John</hi> 19 28. And your ſelves will not deny this, but the death of Chriſt is a ſufficient ranſom and ſatisfaction for all the ſins of the world, and therefore <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Miſſa, cap.</hi> 25. grants this, That <hi>the vertue of his once offering up upon the croſs, is infinit and everlasting, to ſanctifie us, ſo that there needs not another ſacrifice of the croſs, or the repetition of the ſame.</hi> And the truth of this is manifeſt: for if Chriſt muſt be offered up in the Maſs to ſatisfie for our ſins, he muſt die again, and ſuffer again. For what is it to ſatisfie God, but to pay to God that which we ow? And what ow we unto him for our ſins, but death: for death is the ſtipend of ſin? So that to ſatisfie God for our ſins, is to die for our ſins: &amp; therefore we ſay, Chriſt hath once ſatisfied for our ſins, becauſe he hath once payed our debt, which is death: that is, he hath once died for our ſins. So then either Chriſt hath not fully ſatisfied for our ſins, by his once death upon the croſs (which is impiety to think) or elſe the Lord craves a debt already payed, over again: (which is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy) or elſe Chriſt needs not to be offered up in your Maſs, to ſatisfie for our ſins. And ſo your ſacrifice of the Maſs avails not for to ſatisfie for our ſins.</p>
                  <p>Let us come to the next: If ye will ſay, He is offered up in the Maſs for to apply the vertue of the death of Chriſt unto us, (which your Church alſo ſayes.) Firſt, I ſay,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106559:113"/> Chriſt is applyed to us, when he is offered, not to God in a ſacrifice, but to us in the Word and Sacraments: therefore he ſhould not be offered up to God in a ſacrifice, but offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us in his Word and Sacraments, that he may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to us: for it is the Word and Sacraments which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly applyes Chriſt and his death to us, and not a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: for in a ſacrifice, the thing which is ſacrificed, is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to God, and not applyed to us. Next, I ſay, if your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice ſerves but to apply the vertue of Chriſt his ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto us: then it is manifeſt, the ſatisfaction is already made: For firſt, the ſalve muſt be made, before it can be applyed. So your Church here errs, which ſaith, Your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs is propiciatory to appeaſe the wrath of God, and alſo applicatory to apply the ſame to us. I ſay, thirdly, if Chriſt ſhould be ſacrificed again, that the vertue of his death may be made effectual in us, then alſo ſhould he be conceived again in the womb of the Virgin, born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, die again, and riſe again; that the vertue of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, birth, death, and reſurrection, ſhould be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us: for will you ſay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> That he muſt be ſacrificed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to apply the vertue of his ſacrifice upon the croſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us? and what reaſon then can ye pretend for you where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhould not be incarnat again, die again, and riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that the vertue of theſe may be applyed to us? Do you think this abſurd? What is the cauſe then that ye will not bluſh at the other? Fourthly, I ſay, if your ſacrifice of the Maſs be an application of Chriſt his ſacrifice, then it is not the ſacrifice it ſelf: for the applying of the ſalve, is not the ſalve itſelf: and therefore ſince you ſay that it is the applying of Chriſt his ſacrifice, wherefore ſhould ye ſay that Chriſt is ſacrificed in it: for theſe two cannot ſtand together? Fifthly, in Baptiſm, the ſacrifice of Chriſt, and the vertue of his death is truly applyed unto us: and yet ye will confeſs that Chriſt is not ſacrificed in Baptiſm.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106559:113"/> Wherefore then may not the vertue of his death and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice be applyed to us in the Sacrament of the Supper, and yet he not ſacrificed again in it? And laſt of all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you, neither any creature, ſhould appoint or make mo means of the applying of Chriſt and his death to us, then is ſet down in his Word: But his Word only ſets down the inward operation of Gods Spirit applying it to us, and faith upon our part apprehending it: and the Word, the Sacraments and Diſcipline proponing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the ſame unto us. But never a ſyllable in the whole Scripture, that the Lord hath appointed your ſacrifice of the Maſs to apply the death of Chriſt unto us. Seeing therefore your ſacrifice of the Maſs neither ſatisfies for our ſins (for Chriſt by his death hath done that ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) nor yet applyes the ſatisfaction once made by the death of Chriſt unto us (for that is done by the Spirit and faith inwardly, and by the Word, Sacraments, and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline outwardly, and that ſufficiently:) Therefore your ſacrifice of the Maſs is needleſs, and ſerves to no uſe in the earth.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the Scripture ever conjoins With the ſacrifice of Chriſt, his death: ſo that he cannot be ſacrificed but by dying, as the Scripture plainly teſtifies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25.26. <hi>Not that he ſhould offer up himſelf often, for then muſt he have often ſuffered from the foundation of the world.</hi> The ſame may be ſeen alſo in ſundry other places, whereof I have quoted a few, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. and 9.14. So the Scripture ſaith, <hi>if he muſt be often offered up, he muſt often ſuffer.</hi> And <hi>Bellarmin lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de miſſa, fol.</hi> 725. ſaith, <hi>That if there he not a true and a real ſlaughter of Chriſt in the Maſs, then the Maſs is not a true and real ſacrifice.</hi> But the Scripture ſaith plainly, that he hath <hi>but once died;</hi> and I ſuppoſe you will not ſay that he is to die again: Therefore ſeeing he cannot die again, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be offered up again: For the Scripture acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:106559:114"/> no ſacrifice of Chriſt, but that which is joined with his death.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> grants, that in all external ſacrifices, the ſacrifice muſt be changed, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de miſſa, cap.</hi> 2. <hi>fol.</hi> 693. <hi>&amp;</hi> 604. <hi>It is alſo required,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in a true ſacrifice, that that which is to be ſacrificed be utterly deſtroyed.</hi> And in another place, <hi>cap.</hi> 27. <hi>lib. de Miſſa, fol.</hi> 726. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>fol.</hi> 604. <hi>That which is offered is ordained to a true, real, and voluntar deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> But Chriſt now being glorified, cannot be changed and utterly deſtroyed: therefore he cannot be ſacrificed, if your ſelves ſpeak true: or elſe as oft as he is ſacrificed in your Maſs, he is utterly deſtroyed: which is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Where there is remiſſion of ſins, there is no more offering, Heb.</hi> 10.18. That is, all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal propiciatory ſacrifice ceaſes: but remiſſion of ſins is already obtained by the death of Chriſt, as the Scripture teſtifieth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. and your ſelves will not deny. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there needs no more oblation of Chriſt in your Maſs for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That without ſhedding of blood, there is no remiſſion. Heb.</hi> 9 22 But in your ſacrifice of the Maſs, there is no ſhedding of blood, as your ſelves grants; For ye call it an unbloody ſacrifice: therefore by your ſacrifice of the Maſs, there is no remiſſion of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Further, the Scripture acknowledges no other Prieſt of the New Teſtament, but Chriſt only: <hi>Theſe Prieſts,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> 5. <hi>and</hi> 7. ſpeaking of the Prieſts of the Old Teſtament, <hi>were many, becauſe death hindered them to indure: but he</hi> (ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>becauſe he abides for ever, hath an everlaſting Prieſthood, which cannot paſs from one to another.</hi> So Chriſt is the only Prieſt of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. Now if it be true which you ſay, that Chriſt is offered up in your Maſs, and that by your Maſs-Prieſts,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:106559:114"/> then are there mo Prieſts of the New Teſtament then Chriſt, which is plain againſt the Scriptures. What will you ſay to this? That Chriſt is the principal Prieſt of the New Teſtament, and yours are ſecondary Prieſts, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, by whoſe miniſtery he offereth up himſelf to God. But, firſt, was not the Prieſts of the Old Teſtame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t only ſecondary Prieſts? This you will not deny, ſeeing their ſacrifices were figurs of his, and their Prieſthood figurs of his Prieſthood But the Apoſtle oppones the Prieſthood of Chriſt, not to another principal Prieſthood, but to the Prieſthood of men, which was but ſecondary, and ſaith, it cannot ſtand with that ſecondary Prieſthood in the Old Teſtament: therefore it cannot ſtand with your Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the New Teſtament. And the reaſon which the Apoſtle alledges, will not only ſerve to exclud the Prieſts of the Old Teſtament, that was but ſecundary Prieſts alſo: but alſo all other ſacrificing Prieſts whatſoever, of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piciatory ſacrifice of the New Teſtament. For the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>he bides for ever, and hath a Priesthood which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſs from one to another;</hi> which will ſerve as well againſt your Maſs-Prieſts, as againſt them: For they are mortal, as the Prieſts of the Old Teſtament were: and his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood cannot paſs from one to another, as it might have done among the Prieſts of the Old Teſtament, and alſo doth among your Prieſts. For to what purpoſe ſhould your Prieſthood and ſacrifice ſerve, ſeeing Chriſt his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice hath fulfilled all the types of all the ſacrifices of the Old Teſtament? If you ſay, to ſignifie Chriſt his ſacrifice to come, as theirs did: then that is falſe, for he is ſacrificed already. But if you ſay, to ſignifie and repreſent his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice already done: then I ſay, what needs him to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed again for that purpoſe? For the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doth repreſent him ſufficiently: and ſo your Maſs needs not to repreſent his ſacrifice. And if you ſay it
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:106559:115"/> repreſents his ſacrifice: then I ſay, it is not one with that ſacrifice of his upon the croſs, which you will be loath to grant: For your Church ſaith, that it is one with that in ſubſtance. And I ſay further, if your will ſay with <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Miſſa, cap.</hi> 25. <hi>That this place of the Apoſtle only excluds abſolutly the multiplication of Priests, in the ſame dignity and power with Chriſt:</hi> that then they exclud yours alſo. For if you offer up the ſame ſacrifice which he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, then you have the ſame power and dignity which he had. But this you ſay you do: For it is no matter of the difference of the manner, ſince the ſacrifice is one. Seeing therefore Chriſt, God and Man, which ye ſay ye offer up in your Maſs, is of that ſame dignity which he was of, when he was offered up upon the croſs: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the equal dignity of the ſacrifice, makes the equal dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Prieſt that offers it up: therefore ſacrilegious are your Maſs-Prieſts, and excluded here by the Apoſtle. And thirdly, I ſay, this is a vain diſtinction of yours, of principal and chief Prieſt, and ſecondary Prieſts: For this is the nature of this ſacrifice of Chriſt, that it cannot be offered up by none, but by himſelf. And fourthly, if your Maſs-Prieſts be but Miniſters in this ſacrifice, and Chriſt the principal, as you ſay, who offers up himſelf by you: then I ſay, as ye offer up Chriſt, as inſtruments for your ſins, and the ſins of the people; it ſhould follow that Chriſt offers up himſelf in your Maſs by you, for his own ſins, and the ſins of the people: But this is blaſphemy, and expreſly gain-ſaid by the Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. And laſt of all, I ſay, ſeeing (as your Church ſaith) Chriſt his ſacrifice in the Maſs is one with that ſacrifice upon the croſs: therefore as Chriſt offered himſelf upon the croſs, without the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of ſecondary Prieſts, ſo ſhould he be offered up in your Maſs without the miniſtery of the ſame, or elſe it is not one with that. So your Maſs-Prieſts are no wayes to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106559:115"/> be called ſecondary Prieſts to Chriſt, except in that reſpect that <hi>Judas</hi> with the band of men of war, and hie-Prieſts, were the inſtruments and miniſters of Chriſt his taking, death, and crucifying: even ſo you are the inſtruments and miniſters of the crucifying of Chriſt dayly in your Maſs, ſo far as in you lyes: and in this reſpect keep ye your ſtyle of Maſs-Prieſts.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe they have a common diſtinction in their mouthes, of a bloody and an unbloody ſacrifice: For they affirm that ſacrifice of Chriſt upon the croſs to be bloody, and that ſacrifice of him in the Maſs to be unbloody: Therefore I will take away this refuge and vain ſtarting-hole from them. And firſt, I ſay, this diſtinction of theirs of a bloody and unbloody ſacrifice, of the ſelf ſame thing that is ſacrificed, wants all warrant in the Word of God. For there is not ſo much in the whole New Teſtament as a ſyllable, that tells us that there is a proper ſacrifice of Chriſt which is unbloody: and you are never able to bring one inſtance to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſay, it is repugnant to the Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. 11.12.14. for the Scripture only acknowledges ſuch a ſacrifice of Chriſt as is joined with his death, as hath been proved before. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24.25. <hi>Not that he ſhould offer himſelf often, for then ſhould he have ſuffered often ſince the beginning of the world.</hi> Now if the Apoſtle his argument be true, that Chriſt cannot be offered up often, becauſe then he muſt die often: then this doctrine of yours is againſt the Scripture, that ſaith, Chriſt may be offered up often, and yet not die often. But if you will ſay, this is ſpoken of that bloody ſacrifice: I grant that: and I ſay the Apoſtle knew not, nor never ſpake of another ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: and therefore your doctrine is vain, that would have another ſacrifice, then ever the Apoſtles in the whole Scripture have made mention of.</p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:106559:116"/>
                  <p>And I ſay, thirdly, this diſtinction of yours cannot ſtand with your own doctrine: for if there be a true ſacrifice of Chriſt properly in your Maſs, as ye ſay, then his blood muſt be truly ſhed, and he muſt truly die, for this is the nature of all ſuch ſacrifices for ſin, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> grants it, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de miſſa, fol.</hi> 725 ſaying, <hi>If there be not a true and real ſlaughter of Chriſt in the Maſs, then is not the Maſs a true and real ſacrifice.</hi> And alſo, <hi>In all true, real, &amp; external ſacrifices, the ſacrifice muſt be a thing ſenſible, and muſt be made holy of a prophane thing,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confeſſes: and theſe conditions he requires in the definition of the ſame: but this, I hope, ye will not ſay of Chriſt: for he is holy always, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible in your ſacrifice, and cannot be ſlain again: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore properly there can be no true ſacrifice of Chriſt in your Maſs, by your own doctrine.</p>
                  <p>To conclud this then: For theſe cauſes we reject this abomination of your Maſs. Firſt, becauſe Chriſt cannot be offered up in a ſacrifice, but he muſt die alſo, as hath been proved, and the Scripture teſtifies that he hath once died, and all Chriſtians confeſſes it. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the death of Chriſt is a ſufficient ſatisfaction for our ſins, and ſo we need not that he ſhould be offered up again to ſatisfie for the ſame. Thirdly, becauſe the Spirit of Chriſt and faith, by the outward means of the Word and Sacraments and cenſures, is a ſufficient mean to apply him to us, and ſo we need not the ſacrifice of the Maſs for that end. Fourthly, becauſe Chriſt only is the Prieſt of the New Teſtament, who hath no ſucceſſors, and whoſe Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood cannot paſs from one to another, becauſe he lives for evermore, and he only can be ſacrificed by himſelf, and therefore he only can offer up himſelf, which he hath once done upon the croſs. Fifthly, becauſe the ſacrifice of Chriſt upon the croſs is perfect, and the vertue of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures for ever; and it cannot, nor ſhould not be reiterat.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:106559:116"/> Sixthly, becauſe the Scripture propones Chriſt now ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in glory at the right hand of his Majeſty, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the forms of bread and wine in your ſacrifice. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, becauſe it is but the deviſe of man, wanting God to bear witneſs to it in the Scripture, repugnant to that only one ſacrifice of his upon the croſs, aboliſhing the fruits of his death and paſſion, turning the Sacrament of the Supper in abominable idolatry, cauſing men to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a bit of bread, as the Son of God. And laſt, becauſe it ſpoils men of the fruit of the Sacrament. Therefore in all theſe reſpects it is abominable, to be deteſted, and in no ſort to be communicated with.</p>
                  <p>Unto this I will adjoin ſome teſtimonies of ſome of the ancient Fathers, whereby it is manifeſt what their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and judgement was concerning this point. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Paedagog. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; in ſtrom.</hi> who was near the Apoſtles days ſaith, <hi>We ſacrifice not at all unto God,</hi> meaning with a real and external ſacrifice, <hi>but we glorifie him who was ſacrificed for us.</hi> And then he ſubjoins what kind of ſacrifices they offered up to God; to wit, <hi>a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſpiritual of themſelves, of prayer, and of righteouſneſs:</hi> And upon what altar; to wit, <hi>upon the altar of our ſouls, with the parfume of their prayers. Juſtinus Martyr</hi> ſaith, <hi>in Tryphon. &amp; in expoſ. fidei, I dare,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>affirm, that there is no other ſacrifice perfect and acceptable to God, but ſupplications and thanksgiving.</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>That Chriſtians have learned to offer up theſe ſacrifices only. Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>adverſ. Judaeos, That it behoves us to ſacrifice unto God, not earthly, but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things: ſo we read, as it is written, A contrit heart is a ſacrifice to God. Origen</hi> ſaith, <hi>in Epist. ad Rom. &amp; in homil.</hi> 2. <hi>in Cant. &amp; lib.</hi> 8. <hi>contra Celſum. The blood of Christ is only ſufficient for the redemption of all men; what need then hath the Church of any other propiciatory ſacrifice?</hi> And as for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſtians, he ſaith, <hi>They are their prayers and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:106559:117"/> ſupplications.</hi> It was a common reproach wherewith the Chriſtians were charged by the Pagans three hundred years after Chriſt, that they had no altars; unto the which their common anſwer was, <hi>That their altars were a holy ſoul, not corruptible altars, but immortal altars.</hi> If then the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had no material altars the firſt three hundred years after Chriſt, as <hi>Clemens Alexandrius lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Strom. Origen ibid. contra Celſum.

And if he will believe them, I am ſure he will leave off to be a Maſs-Prieſt any longer: for they all agree in this, that the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt upon the croſs hath accompliſhed all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the Old Law: and that the vertue of it is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and therefore ſhould not be reiterat: and that the ſacrifice of Chriſtians are not propiciatory, but only ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore the ſacrifice of the Maſs was ſo long unknown to the Church of Chriſt, it remains now that we ſhow by what degrees it crap in: For as after the going down of the Sun, darkneſs comes not in immediatly, but there is a twi-light before the darkneſs come: even ſo after the bright ſtars of the primitive Church had ended their courſe, in proceſs of time, and piece and piece; firſt, <hi>the third part of the Sun, Moon and Stars were darkened:</hi> till at the laſt, <hi>the bottomleſs pit was opened, and that great darkneſs came up, as the ſmoak of a great furnace, that darkened both the Sun and the air.</hi> Out of the which this great abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ſacrifice of the Maſs did proceed. For <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> who lived between the 800. and 900. years after Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>Our Savior hath done it once in offering up himſelf: for he hath once offered up himſelf for the ſins of the people: and this oblation is always celebrat every day, but in a myſtery.</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>That once oblation of Chriſt is handled every day by the celebration of theſe myſteries or Sacraments, in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Paſſion, Bertram. de corp. &amp; ſang.

                  </gap>: For the Pagans uſed that ſame word after their ſacrifice was ended, <hi>in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pule, l.</hi> 11. <hi>de metamorph.</hi> And the abuſe eaſily growing in the frequent uſing of this word, it came to paſs by time, that all the worſhip of God, as the firſt prayers, the ſinging of the Pſalmes, the reading of the Scripture, the preaching of the Word, the rehearſing of the Symbole, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the Aſſembly before the dimiſſion of theſe who were catechiſed, was called <hi>Miſſa Catechumenorum;</hi> As <hi>Bellarm.</hi> confeſſes, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de miſſa, cap.</hi> 1. And the reſt of the worſhip of God which was done after their departure, to the demiſſion of the faithful, as the celebration of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106559:119"/> Supper, &amp;c. was called, <hi>Miſſa Fidelium, Conc. Valent. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Bellarm. ibidem. Alcuinus de officijs Eccleſ. cap. de celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Miſſa.</hi> So then this word Maſs which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> aſcribes now unto their pretended ſacrifice, came firſt from the demiſſion, or skailing of the people (as they call it) from the Lords ſervice, and was never heard of in the Church of Chriſt, nor read of in any Author <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> for the ſpace of 400. years almoſt after Chriſt. And <hi>Jerome</hi> who lived in the year 422. and was an Elder in <hi>Rome,</hi> who writ ſo many volumes, made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this word Maſs at all. For that Commentary of the <hi>Proverbes</hi> which is aſcribed unto him, where mention is made of the Maſs, is not his. See <hi>Marianus Victorius Reat, in praefat. in</hi> 8 <hi>tom operum Hier.</hi> For beſide other things there, mention is made of <hi>Gregory,</hi> who lived almoſt 200. years after him. And <hi>Ambroſe</hi> makes mention of it only once, <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> twiſe or thriſe, for all the volums which they writ, if theſe book be theirs. For <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his cenſures upon the ſermons <hi>de Tempore,</hi> ſaith, that many of them are found under the names of others Authors, &amp; ſavors little ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Auguſtines</hi> learning or phraſe. See <hi>James Gillotius in praefat. ad Ambroſ.</hi> And that neither of them in the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the matter of the Sacrament, which they handled moſt largely, the one in ſix books, and the other moſt largely and frequently, and in the fore-ſaid places, they uſed it in a far other ſenſe, then it is taken now in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> for by this word they neither underſtood a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, nor a ſacrifice, as the Churh of <hi>Rome</hi> doth. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> takes it for the whole ſervice which was proper to the faithful, <hi>lib</hi> 5 <hi>epiſt.</hi> 33. And <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in one place, for the demiſſion of theſe who were catechiſed. <hi>In ſerm</hi> 237 <hi>de tempor.</hi> &amp; in the other two places, for the whole ſervice, as well of the <hi>Catechumeni, in ſerm. de temp.</hi> 251. <hi>&amp;</hi> 91 as of the faithful. So rarely was it uſed by the lights of that age, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106559:119"/> in a far other ſenſe then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> takes it now. But what a ſtrange change hath fallen in this word Maſs, the abuſe growing by time more &amp; more? Firſt, from a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to the people to depart, <hi>Ite miſſa eſt,</hi> and that in evil Latin: For, <hi>Ite miſſio,</hi> or <hi>dimiſſio eſt,</hi> it paſſed to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the ſervice of God, and from thence to ſignify a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and from thence to ſignify that <hi>opus operatum,</hi> that work wrought of that abominable ſacrifice of the Maſs for the quick and the dead: ſo that now in end, it holds that place in the Roman Church, that <hi>Minervas</hi> image, which (as was ſuppoſed fell out of heaven in a temple, in the city of <hi>Troy</hi>) did hold among them: ſo that, as they thought, it was their only protection and fortereſs; and as long as they kept it, they were in no danger to have been overcome by the <hi>Grecians</hi> their enemies. So doth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtical Church think of this their Maſs: and this for the ſecond point of the form of the publick worſhip of God in the primitive Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, after the dimiſſion of the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> the faithful who was commanded to remain and communicat, they did offer up of their goods, and firſt fruits unto God, before they did communicat: which (for the moſt part) was of bread and wine, or of their firſt fruits of corns and raiſins, whereof ſo much was taken, as did ſerve for bread and wine to the communicants. And the reſt that remained, was either eaten in common among the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whereof alſo ſome was ſent unto them who were ſick, or abſent, in a teſtimony of their communion with them: (from whence ſprung that abuſe and idolatry in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in carrying of the Sacrament, which they call, the Lord God, to the ſick) or elſe was diſtributed unto the poor. And when the Church waxed rich, as it did after the time of <hi>Conſtantin,</hi> the oblations abounded, and a part thereof was alſo imployed unto the maintenance of the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:106559:120"/> Miniſtery, as <hi>Jerome</hi> witneſſes, ſaying, <hi>Clerici de altari vivunt: altari ſervientes, altaris oblatione ſuſtentantur.</hi> The Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy lives of the Altar, and are ſuſtained by the oblations thereof. The which begat avarice in them: and their avarice brought in the ſacrifice of the Maſs, as we ſhal ſee afterward. Now theſe oblations which were given by the faithful, for the ſuſtentation of the Miniſtery, for the relief of the poor, and furniſhing materials to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, was called after the cuſtome of the Old Law, ſacrifices, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>Iren. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 32. <hi>Cypr. de E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leemoſyna.</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Ireneus</hi> &amp; <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls them. And <hi>Paulinus epiſt. de Gazophyla, pag.</hi> 349. calls the place where theſe offerings was preſented, a Table. And theſe was preſented unto the Miniſter, who by prayer did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrat them unto God, <hi>Juſtin Mart. apolog.</hi> 2. as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the prayers ſet down in the Liturgies: <hi>Tua ex tuis tibi offerimus:</hi> that is, <hi>Of thy own, we offer thy own things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee.</hi> And, <hi>Has oblationes famulorum, famularúmque tua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum benignus aſſume, quas ſinguli obtulerunt:</hi> that is, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully receive theſe oblations of thy ſervants, which every one of them have offered up to thee.</hi> And ſundry other prayers of the Maſs, which can no ways be ſpoken of the ſacrifice of the Son of God, without blaſphemy, as ſhal be ſeen after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>And this was the eſtat of the Church three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Chriſt. But the love of God decaying, and the hearts of men and women waxing cold in the worſhip of God the people did not communicat ſo oft. And therefore we read of the complaints of the Fathers, of the rarity of the communicants, and of their vehement exhortations to the people to communicat every day; or at leaſt every Sabbath, <hi>Ambroſ. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>de ſacram. Chryſoſt. in Epiſt. ad Epheſ. Auguſt. Epiſt.</hi> 129. But theſe exhortations did not profit, and therefore there was
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:106559:120"/> Canons and Laws made, to bind the people to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, at the leaſt every Sabbath, otherwiſe to be thruſt out at the Church doors, <hi>de conſecratione, diſtinct.</hi> 1. <hi>cap. Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus, &amp; diſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap. Peracta, &amp; cap. Hi qui intrant.</hi> And alſo Civil Laws for that ſame effect, <hi>Carol. Magnus lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 138. 182. 167. But theſe Laws did gain but little: for whether it was the obſtinacy of the people, or that they were not preaſed unto it by their Paſtors, they did wax more and more negligent in communicating. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Laws were made, that if not oftner, at the leaſt thriſe in the year the people ſhould communicat, to wit, at Paſch, at Chriſts-time, and at Pentecoſt, otherwiſe not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted as Chriſtians, <hi>Diſtinct.</hi> 2. <hi>cap. Seculares, &amp; cap. Si non, &amp; cap. Scis homo, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 45. <hi>ad</hi> 3.38. But for all this the people did not communicat, for the moſt part: So that in end a Law was made, that at the leaſt once in the year they ſhould communicat; to wit, at Paſch, <hi>Extra de poenit. &amp; remiſſ. cap. Omnis.</hi> The which cuſtome is yet kept in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> So by theſe degrees the Communion was loſt in the celebration of the Supper among the people. Firſt, from a dayly Communion in ſome places, to once in the week: and from thence, to thriſe in the year, and from thence to once in the year: ſo that ordinarily there did none communicat but the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery and Clergy. But in proceſs of time this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion overtook them alſo: and therefore Laws, both Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Eccleſiaſtical, was made, to conſtrain them to communicat: and that at the leaſt two or three ſhould communicat with the Prieſt, <hi>De conſec. dist.</hi> 1. <hi>cap. Hoc quoque, &amp; cap. Omnes fideles,</hi> the foot ſteps whereof yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the Abbacy of <hi>Clugny,</hi> where the Deacon and the Sub-deacon communicats yet with the Prieſt And of this came the diſtribution of the bread of the Sacrament in three pieces, according to the number of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municants,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106559:121"/> which is yet uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſuppoſe they have drawn it now to ſignify a myſtery: and theſe three at the laſt was brought to one, and this one to the Clark that rang the bell. And at the laſt, ſome of the Prieſts themſelves did abſtain from communicating: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laws was made, as well Eccleſiaſtical, <hi>de conſec. diſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap. Velatum est,</hi> as Civil, <hi>Carol.

So that by theſe degrees the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion in the Sacrament, was loſt alſo among the Miniſtery: firſt, from an ordinary communion which they uſed, it paſſed to three or four, and from the three to one, and from this one to the Clark that rang the bell: and ofttimes to the Prieſt himſelf alone.</p>
               <p>And this loſing of the Communion in the celebration of the Supper, firſt among the people, next among the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, was the firſt ſtep to their pretended ſacrifice. Now when the people did communicat, there was ſo much bread and wine, in a great quantity brought to the Table, to be conſecrat by prayer, as might ſerve them; then as the number of the communicants decayed, ſo was the bread and wine proportionably diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>And as it came to this at the laſt, that none did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat but the Prieſt and his Clark, and oftentimes none but the Prieſt only: ſo no more bread and wine was brought to the Table, to be conſecrat, but that that ſerved him. And ſo from many breads it came to one: and from a great bread to ſo ſmal a bread, that it might be parted in three: and in end it is come to the quantity of a denier, as <hi>Durandus</hi> a Papiſt ſaith. And ſuch like of the wine, from many great veſſels, to ſmal pottels, from many cups, to one: and from a great cup to a ſmal. And this was the ſecond ſtep to their pretended ſacrifice. Thirdly, from the peoples negligence in communicating, proceeded
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:106559:121"/> their negligence in bringing their oblations: for theſe two were joyned together, their communicating and their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, a part whereof was taken for the maintenance of the Clergy. But the Prieſts they would not want their offerings, and therefore they procured civil laws to be made, to conſtrain the people to bring their offerings. Therefore <hi>Charles the Great</hi> made a law, <hi>Carolus Magnus lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 94. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 6. <hi>That the people might be admoniſhed to communicat, and to bring their offerings every Sabbath:</hi> for the one ceaſing, the other ceaſed alſo: and the Prieſt did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the one, under the pretext of the other.</p>
               <p>And here was the third ſtep, the avarice of the Prieſts. But while as neither Civil nor Eccleſiaſtical Laws could prevail with the people to make them to communicat, and to bring their offerings, they deviſed this damnable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and taught it to the people, <hi>That not only the Lords Supper was a Sacrament, and ſo was profitable only to them that did comunicat; but alſo it was a ſacrifice to God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was profitable for all them that were beholders of it, and by the merit thereof they might obtain mercy and grace: yea, that it was not only meritorious to the beholders, but alſo to all theſe for whom the Prieſt ſaid it, as well dead as living, abſent, as preſent, not only for the ſoul, but alſo for all other neceſſities, as well of beaſts, as of men, ſo being they brought their offerings alſo to the Priest the which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aught be meritorious, both for them and theirs.</hi> For to keep the people therefore in ſome devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as we ſay, &amp; for to move them to bring their offerings unto the Prieſts, this doctrine of Chriſts Sacrament, that it was a moſt meritorious ſacrifice: and of the peoples obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they were profitable for them and theirs, was firſt invented by the avaricious Clergy, and taught to the people. And therefore <hi>Charles the Great</hi> in his Laws, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to the Prieſts to make the people to <hi>underſtand di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly the force of the Maſs, how far it was profitable both for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:106559:122"/> them and theirs, both for the living and the dead.</hi> And to the people. <hi>That they ſhould bring their offerings continually unto the Priest, and that becauſe their offerings to the Prieſt was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, both to themſelves, and alſo to theſe that appertained to them.</hi> Now as for the Prieſts part, they needed not laws to urge them to teach this doctrine: For they were carried, as it were, with the chariots of their avarice to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the ſame, for otherwiſe their Maſſes would have been left deſolat. And from thence came this their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that the Maſs ſerved <hi>to appeaſe Gods wrath, to obtain remiſſion of ſins, Gabriel Biel lect.</hi> 85 <hi>in expoſ.

And from hence came this three-fold <hi>force which, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe unto their Maſs: the one moſt general for all; another more ſpecial for him that ſaith it; and the third after a midway, which was in the hands of the Prieſt, to apply it to what perſon, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, dead or living it pleaſeth him, equally or unequally: and that God the Father diſpenſeth the fruits thereof according to the determination of the Prieſt, Gabriel Biel lect.</hi> 26. And from this did ſpring their treaſures and riches, through the aboundance of the peoples oblations: and from this came alſo the rich Donations, Prebends, Colledges, and Lands, as may be ſeen by the common form of the if donations in their Charters: <hi>I offer to God all the things which are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this Charter, for the remiſſion of my own ſins, and of my parents, to maintain the ſervice of God in ſacrifices and Maſſes.</hi> As the Scribes and Phariſees therefore taught the people, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.5.6. that by offering a gift, albeit they honored not their father and mother, yet they ſhould be free, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:106559:122"/> have profit, abrogating the Commandments of God through their traditions: ſo did the Prieſts teach the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that ſuppoſe they neglected the commandment of God in communicating in the Sacrament; yet by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at the ſacrifice, and by their gifts that they offered unto them, they ſhould be free from that ſin, and ſhould have profit, not only to themſelves, but alſo to all that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained unto them. And to content the people that they ſhould not be offended that they were deprived of the Communion, and received nothing for their offerings, but a bare ſight, and hearing of the Prieſt, eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all himſelf alone, they invented their holy bread, which they diſtributed unto the people every Sabbath: and the kiſſing of the <hi>Pax,</hi> that is, the covering of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, to ſupply the want of the Communion, whereby they might think that they were not altogether fruſtrat of the ſame.</p>
               <p>And as for the people, becauſe they received not the love of the truth (for no exhortation or admonition, no Laws Eccleſiaſtical nor Civil, could make them to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Lords inſtitution, in receiving the ſweet pledges of their ſalvation, as the Lord had commanded) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord gave them over, as it was fore-told, <hi>to ſtrong deluſions, that they might believe lies.</hi> And beſide this juſt judgement of God, as this doctrine was moſt profitable to the Prieſts, ſo was it moſt agreeable to their corruption, and therefore was eaſily embraced and believed. For what was more eaſie to practiſe, then to hear and ſee a Maſs, and to bring their offering unto the Prieſt? This required no examination of themſelves before: no morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of their ſin: no ſad and heavy hearts, with fear and trembling to come to the ſame, as the Communion did; but only their eyes to ſee, and ears to hear, ſuppoſe they neither knew nor underſtood what was ſaid or done
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:106559:123"/> in the ſame. And yet what was ſo profitable as it was, which was <hi>able to obtain remiſſion of ſins, and redemption of ſouls, to appeaſe Gods wrath, and to obtain all grace, and to help for all neceſsities, both for the living and dead, preſent and abſent, man and beast,</hi> as they affirmed? So this was not the ſtrait way to ſalvation: for who was not able to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe this doctrine? that is, to ſee and hear a Maſs. And yet our Savior ſaith, <hi>The way is ſtrait that leads to eternal life, and many ſhal ſeek to enter in, and ſhal not be able, Matth.</hi> 7.13. From this ſprang the aboundance of their obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they ſpared neither ſilver nor gold, houſes, lands, nor heritages: For what would not a man give to get ſalvation ſo eaſily both to himſelf and to others? So it was no wonder ſuppoſe the Prieſts were earneſt in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the ears of the people ſuch a profitable doctrine for themſelves: For it was a gold mine unto them. And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the people (having forſaken the love of the truth, and being given over of God to believe ſuch ſtrong deluſions, for the contempt of his ordinance) embraced ſuch a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible doctrine, which brought heaven to them and theirs; ſo eaſily as they ſupponed: and by theſe degrees the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſacrifice of the Maſs was not a little promoved. And yet theſe abuſes crap not in while after <hi>Gregory the Great,</hi> who lived in the 600. year after Chriſt, ſuppoſe a great part of theſe abuſes is aſcribed to him.</p>
               <p>Hitherto now hath this ſacrifice been confuſedly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and all things almoſt prepared for her birth. From theſe now followeth other corruptions, which did ripen this monſtrous birth.</p>
               <p>As firſt, where the Prieſt was wont to bleſs and conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>crat by prayer, ſo much bread &amp; wine as might ſerve the whole people who did communicat in the primitive Church: the communion of the people in this Sacrament being loſt, as we heard before, and the Prieſt himſelf alone, or at the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:106559:123"/> leaſt, two or three with him only communicating: the oblations of the people which was not only of bread, and wine, and water, according to the expreſs Canons of the Church, <hi>de conſecrat. diſt</hi> 2 <hi>cap. Non oportet, &amp; cap. In ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento.</hi> But (corruption growing with the riches of the Church) alſo of gold, ſilver, of ſheep and oxen, as we read in the time of <hi>Gregory, in Dialog.</hi> Theſe obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I ſay, was not brought unto the altar to be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by prayers to God, but only ſo much bread and wine as might ſerve the Prieſt only, and which at laſt (the abuſe growing) he began to make himſelf, and to bring unto the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Upon the which followed other two abuſes. The firſt, that the ſtile of <hi>(offering)</hi> and <hi>(ſacrifice)</hi> in the Sacrament was taken from the peoples action of offering &amp; their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, for the which cauſe eſpecially the Sacrament was called a ſacrifice: &amp; therefore the prayer in the Canon was not in <hi>Gregories</hi> time, <hi>pro quibus tibi offerimus: for the which we offer unto thee:</hi> but, <hi>qui tibi offerunt, who do offer to thee.</hi> And their oblation was called ſacrifices, as is manifeſt by the ordinance of Pope <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> where it is ordained that the ſacrifices which the people ſhould offer up in the Maſs, ſhould be diſtribut in four parts. This ſtile (I ſay) of offering and ſacrifice, was taken from them, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed only to the Prieſts action: and his action was called the ſacrifice. And this was no little ſtep to their pretended ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>The next which did put even ſome life and breath in it, was the applying of all the prayers which was uſed to be ſaid and made in the ſanctification of the oblations of the people, to the ſanctification of that ſmal round bread, and portion of wine which was reſerved for the Sacrament, and appointed for the Prieſt, and the few that was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat with him. So that here was a manifeſt change,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:106559:124"/> wherein they paſſed from the oblations of the gifts, which was preſented to God by the people, and offered to him in the Sacrament of the Supper, which were called ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as we have proved it before; to a ſacrifice of a round bread, and a little cup of wine, which the Prieſt only, or at the leaſt with other two or three, eat and drink in the ſame; and conſequently from a ſacrifice of the fruits of the earth offered to God by the people, to a ſacrifice of the eternal Son of God, which the Prieſt ſupponed he offered up to God in the ſame. So by this means it received, as it were, ſome life and breath.</p>
               <p>This alteration is ſo manifeſt, that the prayers in their own Canon of the Maſs and Liturgies, will prouve the ſame: <hi>Precamur te,</hi> ſaith the Canon, <hi>ut accepta habeas &amp; benedicas haec dona, haec munera, haec ſancta ſacrificia illibata;</hi> that is, <hi>We pray thee, thou wouldeſt accept and bleſs theſe gifts, theſe preſents, theſe holy and unſpotted ſacrifices.</hi> And again, <hi>Remember of them, pro quibus tibi offerimus, vel qui tibi offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt hoc ſacrificium laudis, pro ſe ſuiſque omnibus;</hi> that is, <hi>Theſe for whom we offer unto thee, or who doth offer unto thee, this ſacrifice of praiſe for themſelves, and all theirs.</hi> And again, <hi>Supra quae ſereno &amp; propitio vultu reſpicere digneris, &amp; accepta habere ſicut accepta habere dignatus es munera Abe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, Abrahae, Melchiſedech, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>That thou wouldeſt vouchſafe to look upon them with a favorable and merciful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as thou hast vouchſafed to accept of the gifts of Abel, Abraham and Melchiſedeck, &amp;c.</hi> And again, <hi>Jube haec per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferri per manus angeli tui in ſublime altare tuum;</hi> that is, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to be carried by the hands of thy angel unto thine hie altar in the ſight of thy Majesty.</hi> And again, <hi>Tua de tuis;</hi> that is, <hi>We offer of thy own, thy own to thee.</hi> I would ask you, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> dare ye in your conſcience ſay, that theſe prayers were made of the eternal Son of God, whom ye pretend to offer up in your Maſſes? For can either the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:106559:124"/> words themſelves be underſtood of him without great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity? Or can they be applyed to him without horrible blaſphemy? And may not every one ſee, that they were conceived and made of the gifts and ſacrifices of praiſe, which the people did offer up to God in the Sacrament? And they ſpeak here in the plural number of many, and the ſacrifice of the Son of God is but one.</p>
               <p>Next, they are called <hi>gifts preſents, thy own, gifts of thy own, &amp; ſacrifices of praiſes,</hi> which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſpoken of the real ſacrifice of the Son of God, which is a propitiatory ſacrifice, &amp; are not called gifts, preſents, and ſacrifices of praiſes of the people. Thirdly, they ſay, <hi>Remember them who offers unto thee their gifts, for themſelves and theirs,</hi> which cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of any, but of the people that offered their offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of their fruits unto the Lord. For you will not ſay that the people offers up the Son of God, but only the Prieſt. And what Chriſtian heart can think that theſe prayers can be applyed to him without horrible blaſphemy: as to duſt and aſhes to interceed by prayer to God the Father for his beloved Son, to pray him to <hi>accept in his favor, to bleſs and ſanctify</hi> his own beloved Son, who is the fountain of all bleſſing and holineſs, and in whom the fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwels: and to look upon him <hi>with a merciful and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable countenance, and to daign to vouchſafe to accept</hi> of him, in whom and with whom he is well pleaſed: who is his Fathers dayly delight and joy, and <hi>to accept of him, as he did of the ſacrifices of Abel, Abraham, and Melchiſedeck;</hi> comparing that bleſſed ſacrifice of himſelf, with the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the fruits of the earth, and beaſts of the field, as theirs was: without the which neither their ſacrifices nor perſons would ever have pleaſed God: and to pray to God the Father, <hi>to command the Angels (in whom, as Job ſaith, he found no purity) to carry his own eternal Son up to heaven in his preſence;</hi> as though he were not as able now to aſcend
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:106559:125"/> from thence to heaven, if he were there, being glorified, without the help of Angels, as he did after his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Now let any Chriſtian heart judge whither theſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers can be conceived without blaſphemy of the eternal Son of God, or not And after the conſecration they have this prayer in their Ganon, <hi>By whom thou creates, ſanctifies, quickens, bleſſes, and gives to us all theſe good things;</hi> which can no ways be applyed unto the ſacrifice of Chriſt, unleſs they will have him a creature dayly made, bleſſed and quickned in their Maſs: but unto the gifts and preſents of the people, which they offered up to God in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And in the Liturgy which they aſcribe to <hi>Clement,</hi> the prayer is, <hi>Pro dono oblato;</hi> that is, <hi>for the gift which is offered up, that it would pleaſe God to receive it in his altar, through the interceſſion of his Christ, in a ſweet ſmelling ſavor, Clemens lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. which no ways can be applyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſacrifice of the Son of God. For here they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly diſtinguiſhed, the gift offered, and the interceſſion of Chriſt, for the which they deſire God to accept of the gift offered. So here is a moſt notorious corruption, wherein they apply all the prayers, which were firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and made of the gifts and preſents of the people, which they offered up to God in the Sacrament, to the pretended ſacrifice of the Son of God. And from the offerings of the people which was many, they paſs to an oblation which was offered: For a Sacrament of praiſe, to a Sacrament which the Prieſt conſumeth all himſelf: from a Sacrament to confirm us of our ſalvation in Chriſt, to a propiciatory ſacrifice of the Son of God, for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſouls: and from a commemoration of the death of Chriſt in the Sacrament, to a real immolation and offering of him up again, and that not for the living only, but for the dead alſo.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:106559:125"/>
               <p>By theſe degrees then hath this monſtrous ſacrifice been conceived, formed, received life, and brought forth into the world. Now many other things did concurr to the ſtrengthening of her, and the rooting of her in the hearts and conſciences of men: as firſt, the word <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> which was frequently uſed by the Fathers of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Church, taken from the Old Teſtament, and the typical ſacrifices there, which they aſcribed unto the Sacrament of the Supper, calling it a ſacrifice. And that firſt becauſe it was celebrated with thankſgiving, which is called <hi>the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of praiſe.</hi> Next, becauſe <hi>they ſacrificed themſelves in a holy, lively, and acceptab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e ſacrifice to God in the ſame, Rom.</hi> 12.1.2 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13 15.16 Thirdly, becauſe <hi>of their offering and alms which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ffered in the Sacrament, which are called ſacrifices wherewith God is pleaſed.</hi> And laſt of all, becauſe it was a commemoration of that once offered up ſacrifice of the Son of God, the vertue whereof is eternal and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
               <p>The next, was the univerſal ignorance, both of Paſtors and people, through the barbarous Nations of the <hi>Goths, Huns,</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> which ſpoiled and waſted the Empire of the Weſt, more then an hundred years full, whereby all learning (almoſt) was buried: and the lights and torches of the Church being extinguiſhed, their ſucceſſors being born and brought up under that barbarity, in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and publick ignorance, they were ſo far from chaſing away that darkneſs, that they rather increaſed the ſame, being given altogether to ſeculare and worldly affairs, as the laws of <hi>Charles the Great</hi> do teſtifie: commanding them <hi>that they ſhould abſtain from ſeculare affairs, from the Court, from warrs, from ſalconry, from lechery from games.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the corruption of languages which entred in with theſe barbarous Nations at that ſame time, through the mixture of people of ſundry languages: Whereby firſt,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:106559:126"/> the language became barbarous: next, not univerſally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. And certainly were not this, Satan could not have prevailed ſo much, in cauſing this poyſon of this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous ſacrifice to be ſo univerſally drunken out by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For if they had underſtood the language, theſe words which they dayly heard in their ſervice, <hi>Surſum corda, lift up your hearts: And ſhow forth the death of the Son of man, and confeſs his reſurrection till his coming.</hi> Theſe words might eaſily have kept them in this knowledge, that Chriſt was above, and they ſhould not ſeek him bodily in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe he was not there really preſent, but was to come: and that the Sacrament was not a real offering of the Son of God again, but a ſhowing forth of his death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til his ſecond coming.</p>
               <p>But two doctrines eſpecially, which by proceſs of time alſo entred in the Church of God, brought this pretended ſacrifice of their Maſs to her full perfection and ſtrength, the one was the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, that the bread and wine in the Sacrament, by the words ſpoken, or rather muttered by the Prieſt, was changed in the body and blood of Chriſt. From time this was taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then what followed but all adoration and worſhip to be given to the Sacrament, where Chriſt is really preſent. Then how could it be but a propitiatory ſacrifice for the ſins of the living, ſeeing it was that ſelf-ſame body and blood, under the forms of bread and wine, which was offered up upon the croſs for the ſins of the world? The next was that of Purgatory; for ſeeing, ſay they, that there is a fire of Purgatory after this life, where through men muſt paſs to heaven: and ſeeing in theſe flames their ſins muſt be purged, therefore a remedy muſt be fore-ſeen: and where is there a remedy to be found, but in the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs, where the Son of God is offered up, that will relieve our ſouls after we are departed? Theſe will
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:106559:126"/> help the ſouls of our parents and friends that are there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Upon the which was founded the Maſſes and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices for the dead: and from thence came the moſt part of the donation of lands to the Churches, to have Maſſes ſaid for their ſouls.</p>
               <p>So then, to conclud, the loſs of the Communion in the Sacrament of the Supper: Next, the ſanctification of the oblations of the people, which at laſt was turned to that which the Prieſt conſumed himſelf alone: Thirdly, the avarice of the Prieſts which bred their damnable doctrine, that the Supper was not only a Sacrament, but a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, &amp;c. Fourthly, the applying of the prayers conceived of the gifts of the people, unto the round hoſt and calice, which the Prieſt conſumed: Fifthly, the abuſing of the word ſacrifice, which the Fathers and Church uſed: Sixthly, the publick and univerſal negligence and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Paſtor and people: Seventhly, the confuſion of languages: And laſt of all, their damnable doctrine of Tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiation and Purgatory: Theſe were the degrees by the which their abominable ſacrifice hath been crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nowriſhed, entertained and perfected in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ſtrength: that at the laſt it took ſuch deep root in the hearts of all men almoſt, that nothing could root it out, except only the power of the Lords Spirit by the voice of his Word. And yet this abuſe was perceived by ſundry, whom the Lord ſtirred up, as <hi>Arnold de Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nova, anno</hi> 1200. and <hi>Albigenſes</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who taught, <hi>That the ſacrifice of the Maſs was a manifeſt abuſe: and that the Maſſes both for the living and the dead, was directly contrary the inſtitution of our Lord.</hi> And ſome of their own Doctors in their writings doth contradict this propitiatory ſacrifice of the Maſs, as the Maiſter of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, <hi>diſtinct.</hi> 12. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de conſecrat.</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin, in ſumma part.</hi> 3. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 83. <hi>&amp;</hi> 73. <hi>Lyranus in Epiſt. ad Heb.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:106559:127"/> cap.</hi> 10. affirming, <hi>That Chriſt once died for our ſins, and that once oblation is ſufficient for all our ſins, and that it cannot be reiterat: and that the Sacrament is an ordinary memorial and repreſentation of that only one ſacrifice which was offered up upon the croſs:</hi> the which doctrine of theirs cannot ſtand with their dayly immolation, and real oblations of the Son of God in their Maſs.</p>
               <p>And that nothing may be lacking to the manifeſting of it, we will ſhow alſo the Authors and times of the entring in of the ceremonies of the ſame. The mixing of water with the wine in the calice, is aſcribed to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the firſt, <hi>de conſecrat. diſt</hi> 2. <hi>Can. in Sacram. oblat. anno</hi> 111. he alſo put to this clauſe to the Maſs, <hi>Qui pridie quam pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Sanct. ſanct ſanct. Dom. Deus Sabaoth,</hi> is put to by Pope <hi>Syricius</hi> the firſt <hi>anno</hi> 121. Thirdly, <hi>Gloria in excelſis,</hi> is put to by Pope <hi>Teleſphore</hi> the firſt, <hi>anno</hi> 139 Fourthly, the ſinging of the Creed after the Goſpel, put to by Pope <hi>Mark</hi> the firſt (and according to ſome, by Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the firſt) <hi>anno</hi> 335. Fifthly, Pope <hi>Zepherin</hi> ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that the wine ſhould be put in glaſſes: and <hi>Urban</hi> the firſt, ordained that the veſſels ſhould be of gold, or ſilver, or at the leaſt of tin, <hi>anno</hi> 213. Sixthly, Pope <hi>Felix</hi> the firſt, ordained to celebrat Maſſes in the names of the Martyrs, above their graves and relicks, <hi>anno</hi> 267. Seventhly, the offerture of the Maſs is aſcribed to <hi>Eutychian</hi> the firſt, <hi>anno</hi> 270. Eightly, the Kyrieeleiſon to <hi>Sylveſter</hi> the firſt, <hi>anno</hi> 314. Ninthly, the celebration of Maſſes in linnen clothes to <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and him alſo. Tenthly, the ſtanding up at the reading of the Goſpel, to <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> the firſt, <hi>anno</hi> 401. Eleventhly, the bleſſing of the <hi>Pax.</hi> to <hi>Innocentius</hi> the firſt, <hi>anno</hi> 405 <hi>diſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap. Pacem</hi> Twelfthly, the Antiphones. the Introits, and the Graduals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <hi>Celeſtin</hi> the firſt, <hi>anno</hi> 427. Thirteenthly, <hi>Orate pro me fratres, &amp; Deo gratias, &amp; ſanctum ſacrificium,</hi> to <hi>Leo</hi> the firſt, <hi>anno</hi> 444. Fourteenthly, the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:106559:127"/> nine-fold repetition of Kyrieeleyſon, and the ſinging of Hallelujah, to <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, <hi>anno</hi> 593. Fifteenthly, the ſinging of <hi>Agnus. Dei</hi> thriſe, to <hi>Sergius</hi> the firſt, <hi>anno</hi> 688. Sixteenthly, the incenſe and offerture reſtored by <hi>Leo</hi> the third, <hi>anno</hi> 800. Seventeenthly, their Tranſubſtantiation invented by <hi>Lanfrancus,</hi> an Italien, <hi>anno</hi> 1036. decreed in the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> in ſubſtance, <hi>anno</hi> 1059. And made the 13.

So that between the firſt and laſt inventers and authors of their Maſs, it is more then a thouſand years. And thus much touching that abominable ſacrifice of the Maſs, which is not the Lords ordinance, but the invention of the Popes, and Clergy of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <p>AS for your Ceremonies, you did moſt wiſely in reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the probation of them till another place: and ſo to hold the Reader in the halfe (as we ſpeak) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye are never able to do it: and it is good to delay to enterpriſe a thing that is impoſſible. But how can you be ſo impudent, as to write that you will prove the ceremonies
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:106559:128"/> of your Maſs by the Scripture, ſeeing the Maſs it ſelf hath not the warrant out of the ſame, but contrary and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the ſame, as hath been proved. And I can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think. <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> that you have ſpoken this in earneſt, when you ſaid, you would prove the ceremonies of your Maſs by the ſame holy Word, which is the Scripture. For what then will you ſay to the Council of <hi>Trent, Seſſ.</hi> 22. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. who referrs not the inſtitution of them to the Lord Jeſus in his written Word, but to the Church by the unwritten traditions. And to <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who ſaith, the Church inſtituted them, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de miſſa, cap.</hi> 13. and ſo referrs the inſtitution of them, not to CHRIST in his written Word, but to the inſtitution of the Church, and to your own Doctors, and Canon Law, and Writers, who aſcribes the inſtitution of them, to your Popes, and others of your Church, as I have proved before. O, <hi>M. Gilbert!</hi> What a prepoſterous love is this that ye bear to your abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſacrifice, that ye are not aſhamed to write, that the very ceremonies of it hath their warrant in the ſame holy Word, and that contrary your own general Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and all your learned Doctors and Writers. I think ye thought that we had never read your ceremonies, or never known them, that ye write ſo boldly of them. Shal the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſay, they are inſtituted by the Church, by Apoſtolical traditions, which your Church confeſſes are not written in the Scripture? And yet are not you aſhamed to ſay, they have their warrant by the Scripture, and ſo openly to contradict the doctrine of your own Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> I will ſay no further, but ſurely either they err in this point, or elſe ye: and if they err, then the general Church may err, and hath erred: and ſo one of your main foundations is gone. Chooſe you whither you will take this blot to your ſelf, or let it fall on them.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe ye account this Maſs of yours moſt
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:106559:128"/> heavenly: and ye vaunt, that ye only have in your Church that heavenly action: and becauſe it is the chiefeſt point of your ſervice and worſhip, which ye give to God in your Church: and alſo becauſe ye ſo impudently affirm, that the ceremonies thereof hath their warrant out of the Scripture: Therefore I will diſcover here, as ſhortly as I can, the abominations, abſurdities, blaſphemies, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, vain, idle ſuperſtitions, Jewiſh and Ethnick cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the ſame, that poor folks be not deceived any longer therewith. For certainly, for as heavenly as ye think it is, I dare affirm that it is nothing elſe, but a very ſink and filthy cloſet of all abominations, idolatries, and horrible blaſphemies. So that as it is ſaid in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> of the vertuous woman, that many women have done vertuouſly, but thou ſurmounts them all, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.23. So it may be ſaid of the Maſs: Many ſervices and worſhips deviſed by man, have been idolatrous, blaſphemous and abominable: but this ſacrifice of the Maſs brought in the Church of God by Antichriſt, in idolatrie, abominations, and blaſphemies, ſurmounteth them all: ſo that the like of it hath never been before it, nor never ſhal be after it. For beſide the fore: ſaid abuſes, that it is a will-worſhip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by man, that it hath corrupted the Sacrament of the Supper, which was given us to aſſure us of the grace of Chriſt, and hath turned it in a ſacrifice, and that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory ſacrifice, and meritorious, not to the Prieſt only, but to the beholders alſo: and not to the preſent only, but to the abſent; and not only for the living, but for the dead: that it hath aboliſhed the death of Chriſt, and the vertue of that one ſacrifice: and that it hath ſpoiled Chriſt Jeſus of his Prieſthood, and communicated it unto others: beſide theſe intolerable abuſes, it abounds and overflows with other intolerable abominations.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, their altars in their Maſs, whereon they think
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:106559:129"/> they ſacrifice the Son of God, and therefore in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their Maſs, the Prieſt ſaith, <hi>And I will go in into the altar of God:</hi> whereby they renew either Judaiſm or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm: for their material altars was a part of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial law of the Jewes, which was aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt: and <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> 700 years before Chriſt, ordained that the Ethnick Prieſt when he went about to offer ſacrifice that he ſhould draw near to the altar. This entry of the Maſs is ſaid to be the ordinance of Pope <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> the firſt, about the year of God 426 And becauſe the Prieſts take the altars for the Table whereon the Supper is celebrat, which he confounds with the abominations of the Maſs; &amp; alſo becauſe <hi>M. Gilbert</hi> ſaid, he was minded to prove the ceremonies of the Maſs by the Scripture; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will ask him, and his fellow Prieſts theſe few things concerning their altars Firſt, where read they that Chriſt did ever inſtitut in the New Teſtament, that the Table of our Lord ſhould only be of ſtone, and not of timber, or any other mettal, as their altars whereon they chant their Maſs, muſt be according to their law? <hi>Diſt.</hi> 1. <hi>conſ cap. Altaria ſi non.</hi> Secondly, where read they in the New Teſtament, that the Table of the Lord ſhould be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated with oyl and chriſm, with a ſprinkling of water, mixed of wine and ſalt, of ciphers of holy water, at the four corners of the ſame, at the middle part, and that none may do this but a Biſhop: if a Clark do it, that he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded, and if one of the Laicks do it, that he be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat? <hi>Canon, Non alij.</hi> What folly is this, that a Prieſt hath authority (as they think) to ſacrifice the Son of God, &amp; yet he may not powr a little oyl upon a ſtone? That the Biſhop compaſs the altar ſeven times, ſinging the 51. Pſalm. <hi>Thou ſhalt waſh me with hyſop, &amp;c.</hi> prophaning the truth of God. And there to bury the relicks of ſome Saints put in a little ſhrine, with three grains of incenſe: that God for
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:106559:129"/> their cauſe may hear the prayers, and accept of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice offered up upon that altar: And then anointing the table of the altar with oyl, and ſinging, <hi>Jacob erected up a ſtone,</hi> &amp;c. Where, I ſay, read you theſe in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, that Chriſt commanded theſe things to be done to the table of his Supper, which ye do to the altars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ye ſay your Maſſes? And ſuch like, where read you that none ſhould chant their Maſſes, but on ſuch altars as are conſecrated: And ſuch like, that your altars are not lawful, where there is not found the bodies or relicks of ſome Martyrs? <hi>Canon. Placuit ut altaria,</hi> Such like, that ye dedicat your altars whereon ye chant your Maſs, to others then to Chriſt, as unto the Virgin <hi>Mary, Peter,</hi> and other Saints departed? And ſuch like, that the Prieſt ſhould kiſs the altar often, and namely when he approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches unto it carrying the calice? Hath Chriſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this? Hath the Apoſtles uſed them? Hath the Scripture made mention of them? What think you will you anſwer to God, when it ſhal be ſaid to you, <hi>Who requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all theſe things at your hands?</hi> And wherefore alſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ye your own law, in having mo altars then is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſeeing by it ye are commanded by expreſs terms, that ſuperfluous altars be deſtroyed? <hi>Canon. Eccleſ. vel altaria.</hi> To conclud this then with <hi>Ambroſ. in Epiſt. ad Heb. cap.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. <hi>As our ſacrifice,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which is no other thing but our prayers and thanksgiving, is not viſible, but inviſible: ſo our altar alſo is not viſible, but inviſible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond abuſe is in the confeſſion of the Prieſt, that he ſaith in the entring of the Maſs, <hi>I confeſs to God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to the bleſſed Virgin, and to all the Saints, that I have ſinned.</hi> In the which are ſundry abſurdities. Firſt, that this confeſſion is made not only to God, but alſo to the dead, who neither ſees the ſecrets of the hearts, nor yet are able to give remiſſion. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is, in the prayer that is ſet
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:106559:130"/> down in the latter end of it, ſaying, <hi>I pray thee, bleſſed Mary, &amp; all the hee Saints, and ſhee Saints of God, to pray to God, that I may have mercy:</hi> wherein are two horrible abuſes: one, that he makes no mention of Jeſus Chriſt our only Mediator, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. &amp; deſires him not to make interceſſion for him: Next, that he prays unto the Saints departed, and makes them Interceſſors and Mediators, who neither knows our neceſſities, and the ſecrets of our hearts, neither is able to hear or help us, which wants all warrant out of the Word of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5 1. <hi>John</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9. <hi>James</hi> 1.17. <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.1.2. 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 6.6. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.30. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63 17. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.6. And ſeeing prayer is a honor only due to God, &amp; Jeſus Chriſt is our only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and Interceſſor; therefore this prayer to Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted is both idolatrous, and injurious to Chriſt his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion and mediation. This confeſſion was inſtituted by <hi>Pontian</hi> and <hi>Damaſus</hi> Popes, <hi>anno</hi> 335. and 368.</p>
                  <p>The third abuſe, is the abſolution pronounced to the beholders of the Maſs: <hi>Amen, Brethren and ſiſters, by the mercy of our Lord Jeſus, by the help and ſign of the croſs, by the interceſſion of the Virgin Mary, by the merits of the Apoſtles, and of all the hee Saints and ſhee Saints, God give you mercy.</hi> Firſt, this agrees not with their privat Maſſes, where the Prieſt and the Clark only are preſent: For how can the Prieſt ſpeak truly, <hi>Amen, brethren and ſiſters,</hi> ſince none is preſent but the Clark only? Next, that which is only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Jeſus Chriſt, to his death, merits, and interceſſion, to make the Father merciful unto us, and to make him to forgive us our ſins, is taken from him here, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat unto the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the merits of all the hee Saints and ſhee Saints: and which is moſt horrible, unto the ſign of the croſs, that by her interceſſion, their merits, and the help of the ſign of the croſs, God might have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. What horrible idolatry is this, to joyn ſuch helpers to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:106559:130"/> the Son of God, who is a perfect Savior? To joyn the merits of fleſh and blood to his merits, as though his were not ſufficient to obtain ſalvation? And as though men were not only able to merit eternal life to themſelves, but alſo had ſuch aboundance of merits, that they ſerved to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy for others: and ſo not only to make them ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viors of themſelves, but of others alſo. And that which is yet more horrible idolatry and blaſphemy (if worſe can be) to joyn with him the help of the ſign of the croſs. Therefore in their Breviary they ſay, <hi>Keep us, Lord, with thy peace, &amp;c. whom thou haſt redeemed by the tree of thy holy croſs.</hi> And in a Hymn, <hi>O croſs, hail; O croſs, only hope, increaſe righteouſneſs to the godly, and forgive the guilty.</hi> And in their Breviary, they ſay, <hi>We adore thy croſs, O Lord.</hi> Now what is it to mock God, if this be not? To ſubſtitut creatures, yea a very ſtock and a tree, in the room of the Son of God, and to aſcribe redemption unto it, and to pray for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and remiſſion at the ſame, to adore it, and to call it their only eſperance? What place is left then to the blood and death of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>The fourth abuſe is in this prayer of the Maſs, <hi>We pray thee, Lord, for the merits of thy Saints, whoſe relicks are here, to forgive me all my ſins.</hi> Where firſt, he makes no mention of Chriſt, or his merits. Next, he prays to God, that for the merits of the Saints he may be forgiven; ſo he puts them in the room of Chriſt. Thirdly, they have the relicks of the Saints in ſuch account, that they have made a law, that it ſhal not be lawful to celebrat any Maſs, but upon ſuch altars where the relicks of ſome Saints are, <hi>De conſecrat. diſt.</hi> 1. <hi>cap. Placuit.</hi> But to what purpoſe is this? To make their altars commendable, and their ſacrifices acceptable? But hath not the Prieſt (as he thinks) in his hands, Chriſt Jeſus, the Holy of the Holieſt? And is there relicks of Saints more precious and worthy, then his blood is? yea,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:106559:131"/> and what relicks, I pray you, for the moſt part? Not of Saints, but of harlots and brigands: yea, they have ſo mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied their relicks, that they have made ſome of them to have mo heads then one, to have mo legs and arms then they were born with. As for example, <hi>Peter</hi> his whole body is buried in <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Vatican, Annal. Eccleſ. Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. and yet the half of him is in another part of <hi>Rome, Via Oſtienſi, Onu. d.</hi> 7. <hi>urb. Eccleſ. cap. de Baſilica;</hi> another part in <hi>Conſtantinople, Bellar. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Eccleſ. trium. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. and his head kept in the fourth place, <hi>Romae Onu. ibidem;</hi> and another part of his head in the fifth place, <hi>Romae Onu. ibidem,</hi> another part of his head in the ſixth place, <hi>Pictavi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And the head of <hi>S. Barbara</hi> was ſhown in ſo many parts, that it behoved her to have ſeven bodies, or at the leaſt ſeven heads, <hi>Luther poſtil. in Evang. fest. exalt. cruce.</hi> And that which is yet worſe, they honor them, adores them, and prays unto them: the which is ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the ordinary practiſe of their Church, that it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no probation.</p>
                  <p>Unto this we may joyn the fifth abuſe, their images upon the hoſtes of their Maſs, and the reſt of their Idols and Images, which they call the Books of the Laicks, wherewith they fill their Temples and Chapels: which they honor, adore, and pray unto, ſaying unto a ſtock, <hi>Thou art my father, and to a ſtone, thou art my mother:</hi> not only without commandment or example in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but contrary the expreſs commandment of God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of Mount <hi>Sinay,</hi> in horror and fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that the Mountain ſhook, and <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf feared: <hi>Thou ſhalt make thee no graven Image to worſhip it.</hi> And contrary the

                  <p>The ſixth abuſe, is in the prayer that the Prieſt ſaith when he offers his hoſte upon the altar: <hi>Receive, holy Father, this immaculat ſacrifice which I offer unto thee, for my own ſins, and for the ſins of all the faithful, both living and dead, that it may profit to me and them, to ſalvation and everlaſting life.</hi> And he prays the like when he offers the calice upon the altar: <hi>That it may aſcend in the preſence of his Majeſty, for the ſalvation of him, and of all the world.</hi> Wherein the Prieſt commits horrible blaſphemy, in aſcribing remiſſion of ſins and redemption, to the ſacrifice of bread and wine, for as yet the words of conſecration are not pronounced: and ſo by their own confeſſion, they are yet but bread and wine: and yet the Prieſt ſaith, he offers it to God for the ſins of the quick and dead, and for the ſalvation of the world. Now what blaſphemy is this to aſcribe that to the ſacrifice of bread and wine, which by their own confeſſion is not changed yet in Chriſts body and blood, which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper to the blood of Jeſus Chriſt? <hi>John</hi> 1.29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. <hi>and</hi> 10.12. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7 <hi>and</hi> 2.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12 Next, that he offers this ſacrifice for the ſalvation of the dead, ſeeing the elect departed are in heaven, and ſo they need no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for them: and the reprobat departed are in hell, ſo no ſacrifice will avail them. And as for Purgatory which they dream of, the Scriptures knows not ſuch a thing I paſs by the mixing of the wine with water, contrary the expreſs inſtitution of Chriſt, and the neceſſity of the ſilver and golden veſſels, or at the leaſt tin veſſels in your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:106559:132"/>
                  <p>The ſeventh abuſe, is their magical bleſſing of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, after the manner of ſorcerers, without the warrant of the Word, and the vertue which the Prieſt prays for, that it may chaſe away the Devil, make whole every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: which hath no more vertue then their exorciſmes and adjurations, which the Prieſt makes in Baptiſm, and in their other ſervices, by their holy water, by their ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted candles, their oyls, anointings, and other like ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. And in this ceremony, they either Judaize: for the Jewes uſed this ceremony of incenſe under the Law, to figure the ſweet ſavor of the ſacrifice of the Son of God to his Father: and ſo makes the death of Chriſt of no effect to them: or elſe they follow the cuſtome of the old Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane idolaters. For we read more then 700. years before Chriſt, that they uſed incenſe in their ſacrifices and other ſervices, which they did to their Idoles, <hi>Alex. ab Alex. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. Some ſay, that <hi>Leo</hi> the third joyned to the Maſs this part, concerning the incenſe, about the year of God 800.</p>
                  <p>The eight abuſe is, in that they make their Maſs a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of Chriſt his incarnation, circumciſion, reſurrection and aſcenſion: and that they celebrat the ſame to the honor of others then to God; to wit, to the honor of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and of all the Saints, which is horrible blaſphemy, to give that which is Gods glory to his creatures. And therefore they have a Maſs of our Lady, a Maſs of <hi>S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,</hi> a Maſs of <hi>S. Michel, &amp;c.</hi> Now if the Maſs be one with the Lord his Supper (as they ſay it is) then it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a memorial of his death, and it is inſtituted only to the glory of God, and not to the honor of any creature: therefore our Savior ſaith, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> and not of his Saints.</p>
                  <p>The ninth abuſe (paſſing by their monſtrous Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, whereof I have ſpoken in another place) is
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:106559:132"/> their round hoſte, taken from the uſe of the old Romane idolaters 700. years before Chriſt, who had little round bread which was conſecrated to the honor of their Gods, which they did eat after the ſacrifice, <hi>Pollux in Onom. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp; Alex. ab Alex. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. So it was not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt which taught you this form, but the ſpirit of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> the Magician, who breathed this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in you: for there is no word of this round bread in Chriſts Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>The tenth abuſe, is the lifting up of the ſacrifice above their head, and the adoring and worſhipping of the ſame, which is abominable idolatry, to worſhip a bit of bread, as the great God and Creator of all the world, contrary the expreſs commandment of God, <hi>Thou ſhalt only worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve, Deut.</hi> 6.16. And how can they excuſe themſelves from idolatry, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own doctrine: for they hold this, that if the Prieſt have not an intention, (ſome ſaith actual, other ſome habitual) that is, a purpoſe to conſecrat, that the bread and the wine are not changed in the body and blood of Chriſt: and if he had a purpoſe to conſecrat but the one half of the bread, the other half is not changed, but remains com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bread? <hi>Summa angel. Euch. cap.</hi> 26. They therefore that adore it, if the Prieſt had not that purpoſe, what do they worſhip but the creature, and that according to their own doctrine? And who can be certain of the Prieſts intention? So who can worſhip in faith that God of theirs, ſeeing they cannot be certain of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prieſt, upon the which this change depends? and that which is done without faith is ſin. Secondly, their own doctrine is, that the intention of the Prieſt ſuffices not, unleſs it be according to the inſtitution of Chriſt, <hi>Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura in compend. ſacr. Theolog. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Hugo de S. Victor, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rardus Lorichius.</hi> Now ſundry of their own learned Doctors
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:106559:133"/> ſaith, that their privat Maſſes, where there is no publick communion, is not according to the inſtitution of Chriſt; therefore by their own doctrine, they are vile idolaters, both Prieſt and people, in worſhipping a bit of bread that is made of wheat, as the great God: ſeeing by their own doctrine, there is no change there in their privat Maſſes of the bread and wine in the body and blood of Chriſt. Laſt of all, ſeeing there are ſundry caſes, and that very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, wherein the Prieſt (by their own doctrine) doth not conſecrat at all: as if the Prieſt have forgotten to put wine in the calice: if the bread be made of other thing then flowr: if the water ſurmount the wine: if the wine be ſowr: if he left out one of the words of conſecration, <hi>Thom. p.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 83. <hi>Joan. de Burgo Pupilla, cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Gerſon contra Florent. extra de celebrat. Miſſ.</hi> Now what certainty can the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by have, that the Prieſt hath fallen in none of theſe caſes? So with what aſſurance of faith can they worſhip their breaden God?</p>
                  <p>To prove this by ſome examples, that by their own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they make the people to commit idolatry in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of their breaden God. About the year 1536. there was four <hi>Auguſtin</hi> Friers hanged in <hi>Sevil</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> who had ſecretly by night murthered their Provincial. The day following, to avoid all ſuſpicion of the murther, they all four ſaid Maſs, but they had no intention to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat, as they themſelves afterward confeſſed, and ſo there was no Tranſubſtantiation there, by their own doctrine: and therefore, all theſe that heard their Maſs that day, by their own doctrine, committed idolatry, becauſe there was no conſecration there. I will ſet down another example. There was a certain Prieſt who being depoſed for his fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy life, wherein he had continued for the ſpace of 30. years with a harlot: being demanded by one, if he had truly repented him of this his abominable life, and if he
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:106559:133"/> had put away this his concubine from him, with intent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to receive her again? He never had, ſaid he, any ſuch purpoſe. Being asked again, how then ſaid he Maſs every day, and made he no ſcruple to eat the bread of the Lord, and drink of his holy cup, his conſcience accuſing him of ſuch an erroneous ſin? At the laſt, he confeſſed, that to avoid the unworthy receiving of the body and blood of the Lord, he did not pronounce the ſacramental words wherewith it is conſecrat. And being urged again, how he durſt commit ſo horrible a wickedneſs, as to give ſo great an occaſion of ſo horrible idolatry to the people, who kneeling on their knees, caſting themſelves on the earth, lifting up their hands toward the altar, ſtriking their breaſts, did worſhip the unconſecrated bread and cup? Unto whom he anſwered, that it was not ſo great a fault as he ſaid of it: and that he was not alone, but many mo did the ſame, which thought it not ſo abominable an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as he made of it. Theſe two Hiſtories I find writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a Spaniſh Author, one <hi>Cyprian Valera,</hi> the title whereof is, <hi>Of the Pope, and his authority; and of the Maſs, and the holineſs thereof.</hi> All theſe then that heard the Maſſes of theſe men, and adored the Sacrament which they lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up, committed idolatry, by their own Canons and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees: For the laſt did not pronounce the words of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, and the other four had not the intent to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat; and therefore there was no tranſubſtantiation there, by their own doctrine, and ſo they worſhipped bread and wine, as their great Redeemer and Creator. But what a miſerable Religion is this, that depends upon the intention of another? And therefore who can be certain, by their own doctrine, whither it be God they worſhip or not, in their Sacrament? And this made a certain Inquiſitor, an enemy to the truth, fearing when he heard Maſs, whither the Prieſt had intention to conſecrat or not, to ſay, O Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:106559:134"/> if thou be there, I adore thee: and ſo by this ſubtilty, he thought to eſcape committing of idolatry. In the time of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> there was three Popes that the Council for their abominations did depoſe, and elected another: Theſe three not being Popes, could not ordain Prieſts, nor give them authority to conſecrat; ſo that by their own Canons, all they that heard Maſſes of ſuch Prieſts as had their authority from them, committed idolatry. This ſame may be ſaid of them that heard the Maſſes of all theſe Prieſts that were ordained by Pope <hi>Conſtantin</hi> the firſt, and the whore Pope <hi>John</hi> the 8. For neither of theſe had power to ordain Prieſts, by their own Canons. And as for Pope <hi>John,</hi> there is no controverſie of it, becauſe ſhe was a woman, not capable of that authority, by their own Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. And as for <hi>Conſtantin</hi> the firſt, he was a laick man, who without receiving any orders, was by force named Pope. He not being a Prieſt himſelf, could not give this authority to others. And ſo by their own doctrine, all theſe that heard the Maſſes of ſuch Prieſts, did commit hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible idolatry. And howſoever the Pope and his Clergy affirms it to be God, and not bread and wine, which they adore; yet ye ſhal ſee what eſtimation they have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that breaden God of theirs, by ſome examples Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh, uſed it for conjuration, and ſought a reſponſe of it; and becauſe it would give him none, he caſt it in the fire, and burnt it, and ſo burnt his Creator. They uſe it to revenge their wrongs, hatred and malice by it: and therefore Pope <hi>Victor</hi> the third, in the year 1088. was poiſoned in the calice by his Sub-deacon. Such like the Archbiſhop of York, poiſoned in the calice. Such like <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, poiſoned by a Dominican Frier in the Sacrament. They uſe it for an Harvenger, ſending it one or mo days journey before, with the baſeſt ſort of the people. The Dominican Friers of the town
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:106559:134"/> 
                     <hi>Auxerra</hi> in France in the year 1536. did burn it, being vomit out by a Frier that ſaid Maſs. And the Franciſcans <hi>de alia Villa,</hi> burnt the Cow which had eaten up the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament out of the Prieſts hand, and ſo in burning her, did burn their Creator with her. <hi>Molon,</hi> one of the Spaniſh Inquiſition, 35 years ſince, being to go into proceſſion upon the day of <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> and the hoſte that was to be put in the box, being ſo great that it could not be placed in the ſame, he being impatient to await while another hoſte had been conſecrat, demanded a pair of ſhears, and clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his God and Creator, and ſo went on forward to their proceſſion. Of the which we gather two things. Firſt, that their Popes and Eccleſiaſtical rable is without all God and Religion, that makes ſo light of their God as to clip it and burn it, and uſe it as the inſtruments of their malice and revenge. Secondly, that this conſecrat bread of theirs which they ſell to the people to be worſhipped and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is moſt abominable Idolatry, whereof one day they ſhal give a reckoning to God. And thus much for the tenth abuſe of their idolatrous Maſs.</p>
                  <p>The eleventh abuſe is, that in your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munions: Firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the inſtitution of Chriſt, ye give not the bread to the hands of the people to take, but puts it in theirs mouthes, as though their mouthes were holier then their hands. Next, ye ſpoil the poor people of a ſweet pledge of their ſalvation, the Sacrament of the wine, giving them only bread: contrary firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the expreſs command of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Drink ye all of this, Matth.</hi> 26.27. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.23. next, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the doctrine of the Fathers, <hi>Auguſt. in lib. ſeu proſp.</hi> your own Canon Law, <hi>de conſecrat. dist.</hi> 2. <hi>can.

                  <p>The twelfth abuſe, is in the prayer contained in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Maſs, in theſe words, <hi>Look mercifully upon theſe things</hi> (to wit, Jeſus Chriſt his body and his blood, which the Prieſt thinks he offers up to God: and ſo <hi>Biel</hi> a expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Maſs, interprets the ſame) <hi>and accept of them, as thou accepted of the ſacrifice of Abel, of Abraham, and of Melchiſedeck.</hi> And in another place, the Prieſt prays unto God, <hi>to receive that ſacrifice</hi> (to wit, of Chriſt) <hi>and to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie it with the bleſſing wherewith he ſanctified the oblation of Abel.</hi> Now if any thing can be ſaid to be blaſphemy, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this muſt be blaſphemy, to a Maſs-Prieſt, a ſinful creature, to interceed between God the Father, and Chriſt his Son; to pray the Father that he may ſanctify his Son and accept of him, as though he were not fully ſanctified in himſelf, and were not the fountain of all holineſs to others; and as though the Father were not well pleaſed in him already. And becauſe the Maſs-Prieſt vaunts that in his ſacrifice of the Maſs he offers up the eternal Son of God in a ſacrifice to his Father, for the ſins of the quick and the dead: I will ask him this: Doth not he blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme horribly, who vaunts that in ſomething that he doth, he is more acceptable to God, then Jeſus Chriſt is? This cannot be denyed. But I aſſume that the Prieſt vaunts that in his Maſs he is more acceptable to God, then Jeſus Chriſt is: Therefore the Prieſt is a horrible blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:106559:135"/> And I prove the aſſumption thus: The Prieſt vaunts that in his Maſs he offers up Jeſus Chriſt to God his Father: the Prieſt alſo in the Maſs prays the Father, that he would ſanctifie and accept of his Son which he offers up: Therefore the Prieſt vaunts that he is more acceptable to God in the Maſs, then Jeſus Chriſt is: for God regards more the perſon that offers up, then the thing that is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up. This is <hi>Ireneus</hi> language, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>contra haereſ. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. cap.</hi> 34. and for this purpoſe he brings forth the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> and their ſacrifices. For he ſaith, <hi>They two offered up to the Lord, but they were not both accepted of him: for Abel his ſacrifice pleaſed God, becauſe his perſon pleaſed him, and that becauſe of his faith: but the ſacrifice of Cain pleaſed not God, becauſe his perſon pleaſed him not, and that becauſe of his incredulity.</hi> Seeing therefore that the Maſs-Prieſt vaunts that he offers up Jeſus Chriſt in his Maſs to the Father: and ſeeing the Prieſt muſt be more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table then your ſacrifice: Therefore it muſt follow, that the Prieſt in the Maſs vaunts, that he is more acceptable to God then Jeſus Chriſt is, and ſo is a horrible blaſphemer in his Maſs.</p>
                  <p>The thirteenth abuſe is, that he compares the ſacrifice of the Son of God, with the ſacrifice of <hi>Abel, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> which by infinit degrees ſurpaſſeth them all.</p>
                  <p>The fourteenth, what horrible blaſphemy commits the Prieſt, when he prays that that oblation which he thinks to be Jeſus Chriſt, may be carried to heaven by the hands of an Angel, as though Chriſt were not as powerful now to aſcend to heaven, as he was after his reſurrection, and therefore hath now need of the help of an Angel to carry him to heaven? What blaſphemy is this? But let me ask you, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> wherefore pray ye that he may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to heaven, ſeeing ye eat him, and makes him to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:106559:136"/> deſcend in your belly (as ye think) and to aſcend and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend are things contrary? And if ye will ſay, that firſt it mounts to heaven, and then deſcends again: then I ſay, firſt, the accidents of the bread and wine are left there alone; for they are not carried to heaven, but remains in your hand: and Chriſts body and blood are not under them, ſeeing he is carried to heaven by the hands of an Angel, and ſo your real preſence is gone. Secondly, ſeeing ye eat his body and drink his blood, it muſt follow that ye muſt make a new tranſubſtantiation, to cauſe Chriſt come down again from heaven, and to make the bread and wine to be tranſchanged again in his body and blood, that ye may eat him and drink him. And ſo theſe are many voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which ye cauſe Chriſt to make: Firſt, to deſcend from heaven by the means of your Tranſubſtantiation, then to make him to aſcend to heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the means of your prayer: and then laſt of all, to make him again deſcend from hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ven, that ye may eat him and drink him. Theſe are the blaſphemies which follows on your blaſphemous Maſs.</p>
                  <p>The fifteenth abuſe, is in their prayer for the dead, wherein they pray <hi>for a place of refreſhment, light and peace for them who have died in faith, ſleeps in peace, and reſts in the Lord;</hi> and yet in the Maſſes that are ſaid for them, they will not give the <hi>Pax</hi> to be kiſſed, which is a ſign of peace: let them adviſe how they will reconcile this. But firſt, I ſay, their prayer for the dead, is without all warrant of the Word: next, I would know who theſe are for whom the Prieſt prays? not for them that are in hell; for they have not died in faith, nor ſleeps in peace, nor reſts in the Lord: and prayers for them are needleſs; for out of hell is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: not for them that are in heaven; for what greater light, or peace, or joy can they have, then that which they have already? Not for them that are in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; for beſide that it is but the deviſe of man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:106559:136"/> to their own doctrine, they that are in Purgatory ſleeps not in peace, but are tormented in fire (if their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the fire of Purgatory be true:) and ſo this prayer cannot be for them neither.</p>
                  <p>The ſixteenth, is your horrible cruelty againſt the Son of God, in breaking the body of Chriſt in three pieces in your Maſs, as ye think; which is greater cruelty then the men of war did to him upon the croſs: for they brake not a bone of him, and yet ye Maſs-Prieſts makes no ſcruple to part his body in three pieces.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventeenth, is your dipping a part of the hoſte into the cup, which is without all warrant or example of the Scripture, and is againſt the doctrine of one of your Popes, <hi>Pope Julius de conſecrat. diſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Can. Cum omne crimen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The eighteenth, is in the prayer wherein the Prieſt prays, that the receiving of Chriſt his body be not to his condemnation, ſeeing he means not here by the body of Chriſt, the bread which is a ſeal of his body, but properly the body of Chriſt: which whoſoever receives, receives not to death, but to life, ſeeing he is life and ſalvation it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The nineteenth, is the blowing and mumbling of the Prieſts on the bread and wine, their turning of their back to the people when they pronounce the words of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration: their ſo oft ſigning with the ſign of the croſs in their Maſs, 25. times: their keeping and incloſing of Chriſts body (as they ſuppone) in a box: their burning of candles before it, <hi>The ordinance of Honorius the</hi> 3. <hi>confirmed by Pope Innocent the</hi> 4. <hi>de celebrat. Miſſ. Canon. Sane. &amp; de cuſtod. Euchar. cap.</hi> 1. their carrying of it in proceſſion upon their ſolemn days, which they call the Feaſt of God, in their Temples, Villages, ſtreets: their carrying of it to the ſick and diſeaſed, with theſe blaſphemous words ſpoken by the Prieſt to the patient, <hi>Behold, my friend, God your Creator,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:106559:137"/> which I have brought unto you: Ordinance of Pope Urban, anno</hi> 1564. What blaſphemie is this? And what a God is this that cannot come by himſelf, but muſt be brought by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And what comfort can this God bring to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, that cannot bring himſelf to the patient but as he muſt be born by the Prieſt? What a mockery of God, of his Word, of themſelves, and of the poor people, is this? Do their Prieſts the thing that Chriſt did in the Sacrament? Did he any of theſe things, or commanded he them to be done? Croſſed he the bread and wine? Did he blow and mumble the words upon it? Commanded he the bread to be kept in a box, to be carried in proceſſions, to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the ſick, to burn candles before it? What ſpirit hath revealed to you theſe things, ſeeing the Spirit of Chriſt hath not revealed them in the Scriptures? You muſt ſeek therefore for a new Goſpel, to prove theſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies: for the Goſpel of Chriſt makes no mention of them: yea, this keeping of the ſacrifice, it is forbidden by your own Canon Law, <hi>de conſecrat. dist.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Gradibus.</hi> So ye both fight againſt the Scripture, and your own Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law.</p>
                  <p>The twentieth abuſe, is their manifold ſtiles and titles that they give to their Maſs, which cannot be all agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſame: ſome taken from the perſons in whoſe name and honor they are celebrat: as <hi>the Maſſes of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, of the Name of Jeſus, of his croſs, crown, and five wounds; of our Lady, of the Angels, of the Saints:</hi> ſome taken from the perſons and matters whereof they are ſaid. For there are ſundry ſorts of Maſſes, for ſundry ſorts of perſons, and matters, as one <hi>for the Pope, another for the Emperor, the third for the King, the fourth for a man.</hi> 5. <hi>for a woman.</hi> 6. <hi>for the bridegroom.</hi> 7. <hi>for the bride.</hi> 8. <hi>for priſoners.</hi> 9. <hi>for them that ſaills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 10. <hi>for them that goes a voyage.</hi> 11. <hi>for the dead.</hi> 12. <hi>for him of whoſe ſoul there is doubt.</hi> 13. <hi>for the peſt.</hi>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:106559:137"/> 14. <hi>for the rage.</hi> 15. <hi>for the tempeſt.</hi> 16. <hi>for the fire.</hi> 17. <hi>for all ſorts of diſeaſes, both of man and beast.</hi> And laſt of all, ſome of their ſtyles are taken from the diverſity of times and ſeaſons wherein they are ſaid: one ſort of Maſs for Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, another for Winter: one for the time of Lent, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the time of fleſh: one for Chriſtmas, another for Paſch, another for Whitſunday, and other ſome for other Feaſt days. Now theſe Maſſes are ſo diverſe, that the Maſs that it ſaid at one of theſe ſolemn times, cannot ſerve for another: the Maſs for Lent, cannot ſerve for the time of fleſh: the Maſs for Paſch, cannot ſerve for Chriſtmas, and ſo forth of the reſt. In the which there are many horrible abuſes. Firſt, if the Maſs be one with the Supper (as they ſay) then as there is but one Supper of the Lord, which is inſtituted only for the remembrance of CHRIST, which is but one in general for all, and whereof all the faithful are partakers, of whatſoever rank they be, be they great, be they ſmal, be they rich, by they poor, and which ſerves for all times. For as our Savior did inſtitut but one Baptiſm to ſerve for all perſons, and for all times, ſo he did inſtitut but one Supper to ſerve for all perſons, and all times. If therefore the Maſs were one with the Supper, it ſhould be but one for all perſons, and for all ſeaſons. But this diverſity of Maſſes doth teſtifie, that it is not the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Jeſus Chriſt, but the inſtitution of Antichriſt, and that it is not one with the Lord his Supper, as they falſly alledge: Yea, it doth teſtifie that they have forſaken the truth of God, and are given over of God to believe lies, and to be deceived by ſtrong deluſions, that they might be damned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what needs ſeveral Maſſes of the Trinity, of the holy Spirit, of the Name of Jeſus? For ſeeing the three perſons of the Trinity are one, and they all concurr in the work of our faith, the Father giving his Son by his holy
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:106559:138"/> Spirit in the Word and Sacraments: therefore this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity as though the perſons of the Trinity were ſeparat, is needleſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this would be marked: that ſuppoſe they have ſtiled their Maſſes from ſundry perſons, yet they have not aſcribed a ſingular Maſs to Jeſus Chriſt, that it might be named ſimply the Maſs of Jeſus Chriſt: and this, no queſtion, is not without the providence of God, that ſeeing the Maſs is not the inſtitution of Chriſt, but of Antichriſt; not the ordinance of God, but of Satan; he would not that ſuch a blaſphemous and idolatrous invention ſhould have the ſame ſtile, to be called the Maſs of Chriſt ſimply, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further addition, as the Supper is called the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they have a ſeveral Maſs to the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, unto the which <hi>Boniface</hi> the ſixth hath given pardon of three thouſand years to them that ſay this Maſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly, <hi>Miſſale Romanum;</hi> as though his Name were a thing ſeparat from himſelf: and as though there were ſome ſpecial vertue in the ſyllables &amp; letters of that Name, after the manner of Magiciens and Sorcerers.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, their Maſſes to his croſs and crown, is manifeſt idolatry, in aſcribing that which was proper to Jeſus Chriſt, to the tree whereon he hang, and to the crown of thorns which he bure; as though either they had redeemed us, and not himſelf who was crucified on the tree: or elſe that they were one with himſelf: which are both blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, their Maſſes to the honor of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to Angels, and Saints, is manifeſt idolatry: For the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was not inſtituted in the honor of any creature, but only to the honor of him who did redeem us.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, wherefore ſerves any Maſs for the Pope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if he be ſuch a one, as himſelf and his Church have
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:106559:138"/> written of him; to wit, <hi>That his will is heavenly: that he may make ſomething of nothing: that he may of right diſpenſe against right: that he may make righteouſneſs of unrighteouſneſs: and that he may deliver as many ſouls out of Hell and Purgatory, and place them in heaven, as pleaſeth him, Extra. de tranſlat. Epiſt. Canon. Quanto in textu &amp; gloſſa, Clement.</hi> 6. <hi>in Bulla,</hi> he needs no Maſſes to be ſaid for him. Either therefore theſe ſentences that are ſpoken of him are falſe, or elſe all Maſſes ſaid for him are ſuperfluous.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, if the Maſs be one with the Supper, then as the Supper was only inſtituted for the living, and not for the dead: and therefore our Savior in the Supper commands, <hi>To take, eat, drink, and to do it in remembrance of him,</hi> which the dead cannot do: ſo theſe Maſſes ſhould not be for the dead. And for what dead are theſe, that theſe Maſſes are ſaid? If they ſay, for them that are in Heaven or Hell. I anſwer, the one needs them not, and they are unprofitable for the other. If they ſay, for them that are in Purgatory. I anſwer, this Purgatory is but their own invention, to draw water to their own mill, and to enrich the Popes treaſures; for the Scripture makes no mention of it.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, their Maſſes that are ſaid for them that are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as for the priſoners, for them that ſail, and are in their voyage, &amp;c. makes it manifeſt alſo, that the Maſs is not one with the Lords Supper: for it was inſtituted not to them that were abſent, but to them that were preſent. For in the Supper they are commanded to take, eat, and to drink in remembrance of him, which the abſent cannot do. Indeed it is true, that theſe that are preſent at the Maſs, do eat and drink as little, as they that are abſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the only vantage they have, is to be beholders of the Prieſt eating and drinking all himſelf alone, and of theſe vain and juglers tricks of the Prieſt in ſaying of his Maſs, which the abſent cannot ſee.</p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:106559:139"/>
                  <p>Tenthly, how can their Prieſts pleaſe God in ſaying Maſs for him of whoſe ſoul it is doubted, ſeeing it cannot be ſaid with faith, and whatſoever is done without faith, the Apoſtle ſaith, is ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.23. And this doubting, as <hi>James</hi> ſaith, cannot ſtand with faith, <hi>James</hi> 2 6. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Maſs of theirs, for his ſoul of whom there is doubt, cannot pleaſe God? But what is all their Religion, but conjectures, and opinions, and doubtings.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, is their Maſſes for the peſt, tempeſt, fury, fire, and all afflictions and maladies, as well of man, as of beaſt, which containeth intolerable and vile idolatry: for every Maſs hath his own Saint to be a Patron, according to the ſubject thereof, and every Saint hath his own office. Againſt the peſt, the Prieſt ſaith the Maſs of <hi>S. Sebaſtian,</hi> and <hi>S. Roch,</hi> for they are the Patrons and defenders againſt it: after the cuſtom of the Pagans, who honored <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Eſculapius</hi> by feaſts and ſacrifices, for to be ſaved from the contagion of the ſame. Againſt the tempeſt, they ſay the Maſs of <hi>S. Bernard, S. Graith, S. Barbe,</hi> and others, in ſtead of <hi>Jupiter</hi> which the Pagans worſhipped. Againſt the rage or fury, they ſay the Maſs of <hi>S. Hubert,</hi> who is the Patron of hunters and dogs, as the Goddeſs <hi>Diana</hi> was the Patron among the Pagans. Againſt the fire, they ſay the Maſs of <hi>S. Antony,</hi> for they make him the Patron of it: and they ſay, it is a greater oath to ſwear upon the arm of <hi>S. Antony,</hi> then when one ſwears by the Name of God. For a woman with child, they ſay the Maſs of <hi>S. Margaret,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Juno,</hi> which the Pagans worſhipped for women with child. For a horſe, they ſay the Maſs of <hi>S. Eloy,</hi> or <hi>S. Antony;</hi> yea, for a poor wifes hen, if it be ſick or loſt. And for their pigs, they have the Maſs of <hi>S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, Alanus de ſacrific. Euch. cap.</hi> 32. But firſt, what blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy is this, to have their recourſe to Saints, hee or ſhee, to obtain of them, or by their merit, or interceſſion, health
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:106559:139"/> in ſickneſs, &amp;c. and ſuch like things, which are only in Gods hands to beſtow: For it is he only that ſends health and ſickneſs, fair weather and foul weather, and ſo forth. Next, the Lords Supper was not inſtituted to be a charm for ſuch diſeaſes of man or beaſt, or for the fire, peſt, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, &amp;c. but for the remembrance of Chriſts death. So that if there were no more abuſe in the Maſs but theſe two things, it is ſufficient to make all men to abhor ſuch abominable idolatry.</p>
                  <p>The twenty and one abuſe, is their mixing of parcels of the Scripture with their abomination and idolatries in their Maſs, after the manner of thoſe who go about to impoyſon any, who mix their poyſon with ſome good food, that it may be the leſs ſuſpected: Or rather as the Magiciens and Charmers doth, who mixes with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh practiſes, parcels of the Scriptures of God; and makes thoſe to ſerve for their deviliſh purpoſes, which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to Gods honor. So are all the places of Scripture which are read and ſung in their Maſs: they are brought forth, not for the truth, but againſt the truth, for their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and abomination: and this they have done, that their idolatrie may be leſs ſuſpected by the ſimple. Next, what warrant have they to prefer the Goſpel (as they call it) to the Epiſtles, in ſtanding up at the reading of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and ſitting at the reading of the Epiſtles, ſeeing they are both inſpired of God, and they both contain the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Jeſus Chriſt? as the Apoſtle teſtifies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.1. <hi>and</hi> 2.16. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. Thirdly, the Goſpel and Epiſtles were appointed not to be ſung and chanted in the Church (as they do) but to be read and interpreted: for the Pſalms and other Hymns in the Scripture are ordained for that uſe. Fourthly, ſeeing the Scripture which is read and ſung in your Maſs, is read and ſung in an unknown language, as all the reſt of your Maſs is done; to what purpoſe doth
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:106559:140"/> it ſerve? And what is it but a mocking of God, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the poor people?</p>
                  <p>The twenty and two abuſe, is their wax candles which they have burning in the time of their Maſſes, in the fair day light, mocking as it were thereby, both God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all light, and the light of the Sun. And to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe can they ſerve to burn in the day light when the Sun is ſhining, but to bear witneſs againſt them in the great Day, that in the midſt of the noon-day they groped in darkneſs, and that they have put out the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that ſhould have ſhined in their hearts? What, ſhal I ſpeak of the reſt of your ceremonies, which are ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, idle, carnal, and Jewiſh? In attire like them: for as their Prieſts were clad in an Ephod, a Myter, a broide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red coat, a girdle, a breaſt-plate, and a robe, <hi>Exode</hi> 28.4. So with you your Prieſts muſt have an Amice, an Albe, a girdle, a fannel, whereof ſome of them are taken from the faſhion of the Pagans. For <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> when he uſed to worſhip, he covered himſelf with a kerchief or vail: and he ordained that theſe idolatrous Prieſts ſhould have their Albe, and a painted colored coat above it, <hi>Ovid. in Faſtis, Alex. ab Alex.</hi> As the Jewiſh Prieſt had a lawer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at they muſt waſh before they ſacrificed, <hi>Exod</hi> 30.20. ſo have yours: as they lifted up a part of the hoſte, <hi>Exod</hi> 29.27. ſo you lift up the whole hoſte: as they ſounded the trumpets at their ſacrifices, <hi>Num.</hi> 10.10. ſo you ring your bells. And what ſhal I ſpeak of the reſt of your vain and ſuperſtitious ceremonies, in waſhing often, in croſſing and bleſſing often, in cenſing often, in ſoft ſpeech and whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, in kiſſing of the Amice, kiſſing of the fannel, kiſſing of the ſtole, kiſſing of the altar, kiſſing of the book, kiſſing of the Prieſts hand, and kiſſing of the <hi>Pax,</hi> in ſmiting and knocking of the breaſt, in geſturing by rule and meaſure, in bowing and becking, in ſpacing forward &amp; backward,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:106559:140"/> and turning round about, and traverſing of the ground: his geſture ſo ridiculous, ſo changeable, ſo affectat in ſaying of his Maſs, that a man would think a player were coming forth upon the ſtage to play, when the Prieſt adreſſeth himſelf to the Maſs: beſide de muſick of your Organs where it may be had, and your three-fold ſalutation of the Prieſt, <hi>Dominus vobiſcum,</hi> which can have no uſe in the privat Maſſes, where the Prieſt is himſelf alone together with the Clark? So that in truth it is more then Jewiſh: For in ceremonies they are above their ceremonies, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders more exquiſite, in cautels more diligent: ſo that it ſeems rather to be a ſtage-play, then the worſhip of God. But I ſee it is fulfilled in them which was fore-told, that <hi>God would ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they might believe lies, that all theſe might be damned which loved not the truth.</hi> Let the Chriſtian Reader judge now, whither the Maſs be an heavenly action, or whither it be not a ſink and cloſet of all abomination, or idolatry, or not.</p>
                  <p>As truth confirms it ſelf, ſo falſhood deſtroys it ſelf: <hi>A Kingdom divided against it ſelf</hi> (as our Savior ſaith) <hi>cannot ſtand.</hi> Therefore their diviſions and contradictions among themſelves concerning this their ſacrifice of the Maſs, is an evident token that that Kingdom cannot ſtand. Some of you ſaith, Chriſt deſcends dayly from the boſom of the Father to the altar, and aſcends from thence to heaven again, <hi>Turrian.</hi> 1. <hi>tract. cap.</hi> 11. <hi>fol.</hi> 59.

                  <p>To conclud this, they will have their ſacrifice not a creature, but a Creator of all creatures: and therefore they worſhip it with the worſhip of <hi>latria,</hi> which by their own doctrine is only proper to God, <hi>Turrian.</hi> 1. <hi>tract. cap.</hi> 17. <hi>&amp; Antonius de Padua, ex Bellarm. de Euchar. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.

Now how can he be the true God, and a true Creator, which hath a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and ceaſes to be, which is not every where, as God is, which is made of bread and wine by a Maſs-Prieſt, and that by their own doctrine? How therefore ſhal their Church be cleared from abominable idolatrie, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips that which they call God, Creator and Savior: and yet ſuch a God, as by their own doctrine, hath a beginning and ending, and is not every where, and is made of bread and wine by duſt and aſhes. O! wo be to their ſouls that worſhip God which made not heaven and earth, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth others to do the ſame! And how ſhal their Maſs-Prieſts be cleared from ſacrilegious blaſphemy, which vaunts that in their Maſs they dayly creat their Creator, and that of bread and wine; and ſo makes themſelves Gods, and more then Gods: For God created but crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but they (as they ſuppone) creat the Creator.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:106559:142"/> And as they worſhip a falſe Creator in their Maſs, ſo do they worſhip a falſe Chriſt and Savior in the ſame. For the Scripture ſaith, That the true Chriſt is made of the <hi>ſeed of David, &amp; of the ſeed of the woman, Rom.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. and not of any other ſubſtance. But the Chriſt which they offer up in their Maſs, by their own doctrine, is made of bread and wine, and that by the Prieſt.

                  <p>As for the fifth point of your doctrine, that the lawful
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:106559:143"/> Miniſters of Chriſt have power given them by Chriſt to forgive ſins, and to retain them. If you mean that they have this power as Gods Witneſſes, Miniſters and Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, yea, and Judges too: (For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We judge them that are within</hi>) to teſtifie and to declare, to judge and give out judgement according to Gods Word; not only by the preaching of the Goſpel, and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments joyned therewith: but alſo by the cenſures and diſcipline, in excommunicating the obſtinat impenitent, and abſolving the penitent. If, I ſay, your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be this, then you injury us, in ſaying we deny it: and you needed not to have quoted theſe places, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the thing which we both teach, and alſo practiſe. But what is the cauſe ye would not quote the place where we deny this doctrine? But if you mean that the lawful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt have an abſolut power, and full authority; not as Miniſters and Witneſſes only, but as Judges and Lords over our Faith, to forgive or retain by their own authority, and that <hi>the very pronouncing of the words of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, is the cauſe of remiſſion of ſins: and that it ſo ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the ſins, and makes them to evaniſh, as the blaſt of wind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes the fire, and ſcatters the cloud,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Controv. Tom.</hi> 2. If you mean ſo, this we utterly deny un-you, and all men; becauſe it is only proper unto God. The which the Jews, ſuppoſe they were blinded, did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and ſo not ſo blind as ye are. For it is only God that forgives in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Matth</hi> 9. It is only his death that hath merited it, and only faith that apprehends it, and only his Spirit that ſeals it up, and the Word and Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that declares, teſtifies, and confirms it. For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He hath committed to us the word and miniſtery of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and we are in his ſtead to beſeech men to be reconciled to God,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18.19.20. So we are but Miniſters of this, <hi>Auguſtin</hi> is plain in this, <hi>Homil.</hi> 23. <hi>It is the Spirit,</hi>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:106559:143"/> ſaith he, <hi>that forgives, and not you; meaning of the Miniſters, and the Spirit, is God: it is God therefore who forgives, and not we.</hi> There is one argument: God only forgives ſins, therefore not man. And again, <hi>What is man but a ſick man to be healed himſelf? Wouldſt thou be a Phyſician to me, with me ſeek the Phyſician thy ſelf.</hi> Here another argument: He cannot be a Phyſician to others, who needs a Phyſician himſelf. Further, he ſaith, <hi>He that can forgive by man, can alſo forgive without man: for he may as well forgive by him, as by another.</hi> But to what purpoſe do ye quote the 9. of <hi>Matthew, That the Son of man hath power to forgive ſins:</hi> For will you ſay, that the Miniſters of the Church have that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolut authority that he had? The which if ye do, then are ye blaſphemous. As for the word <hi>Prieſt,</hi> wherewith ye ſtyle the Miniſters of the Church, I know that you and your Church takes more pleaſure in this ſtyle, then in all the ſtyles which the holy Ghoſt hath given to the Miniſters of the Church in the New Teſtament: For among the manifold ſtyles which are given to his Miniſters, yet hath he never given this ſtyle of a ſacrificing Prieſt, as proper to them, throughout the whole New Teſtament. But as your office of Prieſthood is not written in Chriſt his latter Teſtament, ſo neither is your ſtyle of ſacrificing <hi>Prieſts,</hi> contained in the ſame. But new offices muſt have new ſtyles.</p>

                  <p>SIxthly, our doctrine is, to make the Prieſts of the Church to anoint the ſick with oyl, in the Name of our Lord, and to pray over him, becauſe it is the doctrine of the Apoſtles, as we have
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:106559:144"/> in <hi>S.

                  <head>M. John Welſch his Reply.</head>
                  <p>As to your doctrine of anointing of the ſick with oyl, and that not by every man, but by a Prieſt; not in all ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but in the extremity of death: not with every oyl, but with oyl conſecrated by the Biſhop: (which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> makes eſſential to this Sacrament, <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>de extr. unctione</hi>) and that not all the parts and members of the body, but the five organs of the ſenſes, and the reins and feet: and that by this form of words, <hi>Let God forgive thee whatſoever thou haſt ſinned, by the ſight, hearing, ſmelling, &amp;c. by this holy unction, and his most godly mercy.</hi> The which you will have to have two effects. The one, the health of the body, if it be expedient for the ſoul: the other, remiſſion of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of ſins that remains: and this ye make to be one of your Sacraments. And for this purpoſe ye only bring one teſtimony of Scripture. So that all the ſhow of warrant you can pick out of the Scripture, is this only place of <hi>James.</hi> For I ſuppoſe with <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and ſundry others, you have ſeen that that place of <hi>Mark</hi> 6.13. which is alſo alledged by the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> for the confirmation of this doctrine, would carry no ſhow to make any thing for you, and therefore it may be you have omitted it. But this place ſerves nothing for your purpoſe.</p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:106559:144"/>
                  <p>For firſt, I ſay, this was a ceremonie annexed to the miraculous gift of healing, as is plain, both by the text uſing the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>and the Lord will lift him up,</hi> which is properly ſpoken of the health of the bodie: and alſo by that place of <hi>Mark</hi> 6.13. where it is written, that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles anointed many ſick with oyl, and they healed them.</hi> The which gift was not only given to the Apoſtles, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the very Churches, as is plain of the 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. <hi>Unto another is given the gift of healing, &amp;c.</hi> Now ſeeing this extraordinary gift is ceaſed in the Church of God, wherefore will you ſuperſtitiouſly uſe the ceremonie? So either avow, M. <hi>Gilbert,</hi> that your Prieſts have this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous gift of healing, which I ſuppoſe ye will not, or elſe leave off the ceremonie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by this argument ye may as wel make all the reſt of the ceremonies (which our Savior and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and the believers in the primitive Church uſed toward the ſick, blind, lame and dead) Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. As the <hi>laying on of hands, Mark</hi> 16.18. which had both a command and a promiſe joyned with it, <hi>anointing of the eyes of the blind with clay, John</hi> 9.6. <hi>waſhing in the pool of Siloam, &amp;c. John</hi> 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.29. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.10. For why ſhould not their examples be as well followed, as the example of the Elders of the primitive Church? And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you uſe not theſe ceremonies, becauſe ye want the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous gift, which was joyned with them, why do ye uſe this ceremonie ſuperſtitiouſly, ſeeing ye want this gift alſo?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I ſay, this place can make nothing for your doctrine: for this place ſaith, <hi>Call the Elders of the Church, and let them, &amp;c.</hi> but you call for a <hi>ſacrificing</hi> Prieſt. This text ſaith in the plural number, <hi>Call for the Elders:</hi> your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſaith, one Prieſt is ſufficient. This place ſpeaks of oyl, not mentioning a ſyllable of conſecration, bleſſing of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:106559:145"/> it by the Biſhop, and that nine-fold ſalutation that ye give unto it, <hi>Hail, O holy oyl,</hi> with the bowing of the knee, and other ceremonies. There is not a ſyllable in this, nor in any other Scripture, that ſpeaks of theſe things, and yet your doctrine will have all theſe ceremonies. This place ſaith, <hi>And the prayer of faith ſhal ſave the ſick:</hi> and you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribut it to the ointment. This place puts no difference of ſickneſs: but your doctrine is, that none be anointed, but he who is lying in the bed, and at the point of death. This place only ſpecifieth the anointing of the ſick, ſome of you reckons, as the Council of <hi>Florentine,</hi> ſeven parts: ſome the five ſenſes, as neceſſary. And therefore this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>ſent.</hi> 4. <hi>diſt.</hi> 23. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> to ſay, <hi>That the form of this Sacrament is not extant in the Scripture.</hi> Now if it be not extant in the Scripture, what to do have we with it, ſeeing the Scripture is able to make a man wiſe unto ſalvation, and to make the man of God perfect in every good work?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Beda, Ecumenius,</hi> and <hi>Theophylactus</hi> in their Commentaries upon theſe places, and <hi>Thomas Waldenſis, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de ſacr. &amp; Alphonſus de Caſtro, de haereſibus.</hi> two arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papiſts affirms, that in the 6. of <hi>Mark,</hi> &amp; 5. of <hi>James,</hi> the ſelf-ſame unction and anointing is meaned. But <hi>Bellarmin de extr. unct. &amp; Janſenius, in Marc.</hi> 6. two other Papiſts, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms and proves by firm reaſons, that that anointing in <hi>Mark,</hi> is no Sacrament; therefore neither is this anointing in <hi>James</hi> a Sacrament, ſeeing (as ſaid is) in both the places the ſelf-ſame unction is meaned.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, I ſay, all the Sacraments the Lord hath inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are publick and not privat: but this Sacrament of yours is privatly miniſtred: therefore not a true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, all the Sacraments of the New Teſtament ſhould be miniſtred by them who have the preaching of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:106559:145"/> the Goſpel concredited unto them; and not by privat Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. But <hi>Innocentius</hi> the firſt, a Pope, ſaith, <hi>in his Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8 <hi>Private men may miniſter this in their own and others neceſſities:</hi> as alſo <hi>Thomas Waldenſis</hi> a Papiſt. And yet the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> accurſes them that ſo ſay: Therefore it is not a Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> in that ſame Epiſtle cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, calls it but <hi>genus Sacramenti,</hi> a kind of Sacrament; therefore it is not properly a Sacrament. But you are more bold to call it a Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, all the Sacraments of Chriſt have their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the written word: But <hi>Petrus a Soto, in his book againſt Brentius,</hi> calls this <hi>a tradition which hath not the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the written word:</hi> therefore it is not a lawful Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And as to your argument: That it hath an external form of anointing with oyl, of an internal grace which is remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins. I anſwer: this form or ceremony was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, as I proved before, annexed to a miraculous gift of healing. The which ſeeing it is now ceaſed, the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie alſo ſhould ceaſe. And this promiſe is not made to the anointing (if ye will believe the Apoſtle) but to the prayer of faith. <hi>The prayer of faith,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſhal ſave the ſick.</hi> And whereas ye ſay that we make him a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciner only for the bodie in this, and not for the ſoul: we anſwer: That this ceremonie, as ſundrie others, was only annexed to the extraordinary gift of healing of the bodie, and was not ſeals of grace. And yet with the health of the bodie, the healing of the ſoul was oftentimes joyned, as our Savior ſaith to the paralytick man: <hi>Thy ſins are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee, take up thy bed and walk, Matth</hi> 9 28. Now whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe be our vain ſubterfuges, or clear grounds out of the Scripture, let the Reader judge. And whereas ye call us new men: let them be new and moſt recent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:106559:146"/> doctrine is moſt new. But as hath, and ſhal be proved by Gods grace, our doctrine is not new, but Jeſus Chriſts in his Old and New Teſtament, and yours deviſed ſince. Therefore this title of noveltie moſt juſtly belongs unto you. This for the ſixth point of your doctrine.</p>

                  <p>SEventhly, our doctrine is, that when our Prieſts (which are the only lawful Miniſters now adayes) are called to that function, receives the impoſition of hands, with the grace or gift of the holy Ghoſt, becauſe it is the doctrine of <hi>S. Paul</hi> in theſe words: <hi>Neglect not the gift or grace that is within thee, which is given thee by propheſy, with the impoſition of prieſthood.</hi> And therefore muſt be a Sacrament, becauſe it hath an external form, which is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands, of an external grace, which is the gift given by the ſame. And for this cauſe <hi>(a) John Calvin</hi> himſelf admits it to be a Sacrament: albeit in their Confeſſion they call it a baſtard Sacrament of the Popes, and deteſts the ſame, although <hi>(b) Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> hath the contrary. a <hi>Inſtitut. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. <hi>ſect.</hi> 20. <hi>item lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. <hi>ſect.</hi> 28. b <hi>In locis com. edit.</hi> 1543. <hi>de num. ſacrament.</hi>

                  <p>As for the ſeventh point of your doctrine concerning the impoſition of hands in the ordination of the lawful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church of Chriſt, becauſe it is a ceremony which hath the foundation of it in the word of God, and was practiſed in the primitive Church, as in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Timothie</hi> here, and others: and is profitable both to put the Paſtors in mind of his calling, that he is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:106559:146"/> of God for the diſcharge of the ſame, and alſo the people that they embrace him as one ſent of God to them; therefore we both acknowledge it, and practiſe it. But that either the gift of the holy Ghoſt is inſeparably joyned with it, or that it is a Sacrament of the New Teſtament properly (as you affirm) that we deny. As to the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the gift of the holy Ghoſt is not inſeparably joyned with it; Firſt, becauſe that is injurious to the Lords free grace, which is not bound to any inſtrument, let be to a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And alſo he ſpeaks againſt experience: for how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I pray you, do receive impoſition of hands, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not a new grace and gift of the holy Ghoſt among you? Miſerable experience theſe many ages, both doth teſtifie it; and alſo one hath teſtified the ſame, ſaying, <hi>Our Prieſts do lay the word of bleſſing upon many, but in few follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the effect of that bleſſing, Ex veteri Teſtam. quaest.</hi> 109. <hi>inter opera Auguſtini.</hi> And certainly if any gift of the holy Ghoſt is joyned with this ceremony, it ſhould be an abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to preach the Word: For that is the principal part of the office of the Miniſter of the Goſpel. But how many thouſands are they among you in your Church who have received this impoſition of hands, and yet as unable to preach the Goſpel as aſſes are? And laſt of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that <hi>tryal and examination</hi> ſo ſtraitly commanded in the Scripture, which ought to be had of them that are to be ordained, if the holy Ghoſt were ever inſeparably given with the ceremony? For wherefore is this tryal and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination? And wherefore is <hi>Timothy</hi> ſo ſtraitly charged to <hi>lay his hands ſuddenly on no man,</hi> but becauſe it is only the holy Ghoſt who enables? The which alſo ſhould be well known unto his Church, ere they preſume to teſtifie the calling of God to them. For if it were true that ye ſay, that the gift of the holy Ghoſt were joyned with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands inſeparably, then the Apoſtle ſhould
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:106559:147"/> rather have commanded <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. to lay his hands upon many, in reſpect of the need that the Church ſtood in of all men, rather then to have diſcharged him. And as for the place of <hi>Paul</hi> which ye cite here, <hi>Deſpiſe not the gift, &amp;c.</hi> this ſerves nothing for your doctrine: For if firſt, the gift given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, was extraordinary, and ſo ordinarily doth not ever fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ceremony. 2. It is not aſcribed here to the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of impoſition of hands, but unto propheſie, <hi>which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee by propheſie,</hi> whereby it was revealed to the Church of the ability of this man. And ſo if there be any prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies that go of you in your Clergy, that the holy Ghoſt is given to you, then ye may claim unto the ſame: but I think ye will not ſay that ſuch like propheſies go of you: therefore ye cannot claim to this teſtimony. 3. <hi>Timothy</hi> is exhorted <hi>to keep that worthy thing concredited unto him through the holy Ghost,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. It was the holy Ghoſt therefore who was the giver and preſerver of it. And as for the ceremony, it was a ſign of the preſence of Gods Spirit in them who was lawfully ordained. Now as to the ſecond, that ye will have it a Sacrament, becauſe it hath an external form, and alſo a promiſe of grace. That will not follow: For then you ſhould have innumerable Sacraments: For prayer, alms-deeds, and the ordination of Magiſtrats, and many others, have external forms, and have promiſes of grace joyned with them, and yet you will not ſay that they are properly Sacraments For in all the Sacraments of the New Teſtament which properly are Sacraments, there muſt be firſt, not only an external action, but an earthly and viſible element, as water in Baptiſm, and bread and wine in the Supper. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>in Joan. tract</hi> 90. <hi>Let the word be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the element, and then it is a Sacrament.</hi> Secondly, they muſt have their expreſs warrant and inſtitution from
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:106559:147"/> Jeſus Chriſt in the Scripture, as Baptiſm hath, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. and the Lords Supper, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. Thirdly, they muſt not only have a promiſe of grace, but a promiſe of remiſſion of ſins and ſanctification: For they muſt be ſeals of that Covenant which is common to all Chriſtians, as Baptiſm and the Lords Supper is. But this ceremony of impoſition of hands wants all theſe three: For neither is there any earthly element, neither ſeals it up the Covenant which is common to all, but proper to the Miniſtery only; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath it the expreſs inſtitution of Chriſt in all the four Evangeliſts And whereas in the 20. of <hi>John,</hi> he there or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains his Apoſtles, we read, he <hi>breathed on them, and ſaid, Receive the holy Ghoſt.</hi> But not a word that he laid his hands on them, or commanded them to uſe it to others. The which without all queſtion he would have done, if he had ordained it to be a Sacrament. And <hi>Petrus a Soto,</hi> a Papiſt, ſaith, <hi>That the making of the impoſition of hands to be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a tradition.</hi> Therefore it is not a Sacrament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of the New Teſtament. Secondly, if the ordination of any by impoſition of hands were a Sacrament, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a Biſhop by the ſame eſpecially ſhould be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: For the place which ye quote here is of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> who was a Biſhop, as your Church affirms. And <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> ſaith, <hi>de Sacramento ordinis, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>If this be not a Sacrament, then it cannot be proved by the Scripture, that ordination by impoſition of hands is a Sacrament.</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>If this be not granted, they will loſe all the teſtimonies of the Ancients, to prove impoſition of hands to be a Sacrament, for they ſpeak of the ordination of Biſhops.</hi> But the ancient Schollers and Doctors of your own Church, <hi>in</hi> 4. <hi>diſt.</hi> 24. and <hi>Dominicus a Soto,</hi> a learned Papiſt, <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>de juſtitia &amp; jure. qu.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 2. affirms, <hi>That this is not a Sacrament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly;</hi> and ſo neither the ordination of the reſt of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery can be a Sacrament, ſeeing a Biſhop is above the reſt
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:106559:148"/> in your order. Laſt of all, the Council of <hi>Trent, ſeſſ.</hi> 23. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. is not againſt it; and ſundry of the reſt of your Clergy, <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de ſacr. ord. cap.</hi> 9. makes all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Orders of your Church, as Prieſts, which you diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh in two ſorts; to wit, in Biſhops and inferior Prieſts, Deacons, Sub-Deacons, Exorciſts, Lectors, Door-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and your Acoluthyts, <hi>every one of them by themſelves, Sacraments.</hi> And your Maſter of Sentences, <hi>lib</hi> 4 <hi>diſt.</hi> 24. <hi>cap. Si autem,</hi> calls all the Orders in the plural number <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</hi> So if ye durſt let the people know the ſecret of this your doctrine, ye make not only ſeven Sacraments, but fourteen in very deed. But this were dangerous to you to ſowe abroad: For you fear it would caſt your doctrine in ſome ſuſpicion with them, and be an occaſion to them to examine it by the Scripture; the which if they would once begin to do, ye know your hope were loſt. As for <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Melancthon,</hi> they call it a Sacrament, taking the word in an ample ſenſe; for theſe ceremonies that have the foundation in the Word, which have a promiſe of a bleſſing joyned with them, and not in that ſenſe that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Lords Supper are called Sacraments, as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> in that firſt place which ye quote, plainly acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth: For theſe are his words, <hi>Let the Chriſtian Church,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be content of theſe</hi> (meaning of Baptiſm and the Supper) <hi>and let them not admit nor acknowledge, deſire, or look for any other third Sacrament till the end of the world. And as for impoſition of hands which the Church uſeth in their ordinations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> he ſaith, <hi>I will not be againſt it that it be called a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, ſo being I reckon it not among the ordinary Sacraments.</hi> And <hi>Melancthon</hi> in that ſame place reckons up prayer, alms, marriage, the Magiſtrat, in the number of theſe unto the which he gives this name of a Sacrament: whereby he makes it plain that he takes this word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> amply and largely, as hath been ſaid before, and not in that ſenſe
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:106559:148"/> that Baptiſm and the Supper is called Sacraments. So you play your ſelf, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> in the ambiguity of this word Sacrament, and deceives the Reader with the ſame. And whereas ye call your Prieſts the only lawful Miniſters now adays: I will anſwer to this more fully afterward, only this now: Firſt, ſeeing the fountain and ground upon the which all the lawful callings in your Church depends, and is derived, as your ſelves confeſs, is the ſupremacy of your Pope, whom I have proved to be the Antichriſt in my other Treatiſe: and ſeeing the office of your Prieſthood in ſacrificing the Son of God, as ye ſuppoſe, is moſt abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, idolatrous and Antichriſtian, as I have proved alſo there: therefore you are not only not lawful Miniſters of Chriſt, but the Miniſters of Antichriſt. And as for the ſtyle of Prieſt, I anſwered it before: it is not ſo much as once aſcribed to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, to ſignifie their proper calling, in the whole New Teſtament.</p>

                  <p>EIghtly, our doctrine is, that Matrimony is a bond undiſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe our Savior ſaith, <hi>That which God hath joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, let no man ſeparat, Matth</hi> 19.6. And ſuch like he ſaith, <hi>That whoſoever demits his wife and marries another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> commits adultery upon her, Mark</hi> 10.11.12. And in <hi>S. Luke</hi> 16.18. we have the ſame. And <hi>S. Matthew</hi> 5.35. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.9. is of the ſame opinion (albeit one may put away his wife by him for fornication) this is the doctrine alſo of the Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt: for it is written in <hi>S. Paul, That a woman that is under a husband, her husband living, is bound to the law; but if her husband be dead, ſhe is looſed from the law of her husband. Therefore her husband living, ſhe ſhal be called an
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:106559:149"/> adultereſs, if ſhe be with another man,</hi> and ſo forth. And in another place, he ſaith, <hi>Rom</hi> 7.2.3 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.39. <hi>and</hi> 7.10.11. <hi>To them that be joyned in matrimony, I give not command, but our Lord, that the wife depart not from her husband: and if ſhe depart, to remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, or to be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband put away his wife.</hi> Now this is our Religion of matrimony, and plain repugnant to the doctrine of the Miniſters of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that will licence a man to put away his wife, and marry another. And they call the doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the Popes cruelty againſt the innocent divorced, in their negative faith.</p>

                  <p>As for your 8. and 9 points of doctrine concerning Marriage: the firſt, that it is undiſſoluble for no cauſe: the other, that it is a Sacrament. As to the firſt, I would ſcarcely have underſtood this point of your doctrine. if your Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and others of your Clergy who write of it had not been more plain then ye. And I think, that there are few that knows not this point of your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine otherwiſe, who can take it up by this your writing. I wonder why ye are ſo dark in ſetting down your own doctrine. But wherefore ſhould I wonder: for darkneſs may not bide to ſee the light? Your doctrine then is this. Firſt, you make many cauſes of ſeparation and divorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beſides adultery, <hi>Concil. Trid ſeſs.</hi> 24. <hi>Can.</hi> 8. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de matrim cap.</hi> 14. (expreſs againſt the doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>He that ſhal demit his wife, except for fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.) he makes her to commit adultery.</hi> As 1. <hi>for the vow of continency to enter in a Monaſtery, or Nunry.</hi> 2. <hi>For hereſie.</hi> 3. And <hi>for peril of offending of God.</hi> Next, your doctrine is, <hi>That ſuppoſe there be many cauſes of ſeparation betwixt the man and the wife, from bed and boord (as we ſpeak) yet the bond of marriage contracted and perfected betwixt the faithful, can no ways be broken, as long as they both live together, no not for adultery. So that the party innocent divorced, may not lawfully
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:106559:149"/> marry another, during the life of the guilty party: And if they marry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they call it adultery; and they will have the ground of this to be, becauſe it is a Sacrament, Bellar. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 12. So one error follows and leans upon another. For if marriage be not a Sacrament, then the bond may be looſed, by their own doctrine. But marriage is not a Sacrament, as ſhal be proved hereafter: therefore the bond is ſoluble. Our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, that the bond of marriage contracted and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected between two Chriſtians, is broken by the adultery of either of the parties; ſo that the innocent divorced may lawfully marry another. As for our doctrine, it is plain in the Scripture, in the 19. and 5. of <hi>Matthew:</hi> where there the Lord in plain termes excepts the cauſe of fornication, ſaying, <hi>Whoſoever demits his wife, except it be for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery.</hi> So then by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he that demits his wife for fornication (which is adultery there) and marries another, commits not adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. And ſeeing the Apoſtle commands, 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 7.2. <hi>That every man have his own wife, and every wife her own husband, and that for the avoiding of fornication: and it is better to marry then to burn.</hi> Therefore the firſt marriage being diſſolved by divorcement juſtly according to Gods Word, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the party innocent at leaſt to uſe the remedy of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for the avoiding of fornication. Otherwiſe if he might not uſe it, divorcement were not a benefit, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a puniſhment, and the innocent ſhould be puniſhed without a fault.</p>
                  <p>Now, as to the Scriptures which ye quote, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.6. <hi>and</hi> 5.31 they have that exception of <hi>fornication,</hi> expreſly mentioned. And as for the places of <hi>Mark</hi> 10.11.12. and <hi>Luke</hi> 16.18. and <hi>Romans</hi> 7.2.3. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7 39. they are all to be underſtood with that exception of <hi>fornication,</hi> that our Savior expreſly ſets down in the former two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, otherwiſe Scripture ſhould be contrary to Scripture,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:106559:150"/> which is blaſphemie to think, and our Savior is the beſt exponer of himſelf. And as for the 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.10.11. the Apoſtle ſpeaks not of that ſeparation for adultery, but of a ſeparation for a ſeaſon, for other cauſes or variances, in the which caſe the parties ſeparated, are to remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, or to be reconciled together. And becauſe ye will not credit us, nor the Son of God ſo expreſly ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in his Scripture, yet I think ye will give ſome credit to your own Doctors, Councils, Canons, and Popes, whom if ye be a right Catholick, ye think that they cannot err. <hi>Cajetanus</hi> a Cardinal, <hi>in comment. Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſius Catarinus, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>annot. in comment. Cajetani,</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, hold this doctrine with us againſt the Religion of your Church, <hi>That adultery breaks the bond of marriage, and that the innocent divorced may marry another.</hi> Pope <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Decret. cauſa</hi> 32. <hi>quaest.</hi> 7. <hi>cap. Concubuisti.</hi> And the Concil <hi>Triburienſe, ibidem cap. Si quis,</hi> and another Canon ſaith, <hi>That inceſtuous adultery breaks the bond of marriage, ſo that the party innocent may marrie another, Ibid. cap. quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> And Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the third, ſuppoſe in a Canon he will not have adultery to break the bond of marriage, <hi>Ibid. cap. Hi vero.</hi> ſo that the party innocent may marry another, contrary to the doctrine of Chriſt our Savior, yet he <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a man to marrie another, if his former wife being taken with ſome diſeaſe, be not able to render due benevolence unto her husband, Ibid. cap. Quid propoſuiſti.</hi> So ſuppoſe this Pope will not admit that true cauſe which our Savior ſets down of adultery, yet he ſets down cauſes himſelf, which wants the warrant of the Word. And Pope <hi>Celeſtin</hi> the third, ſet forth a decree, that when of married perſons one falleth into hereſie, the party Catholick is free to marry again, <hi>cap. laudabile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de converſ. infidelium,</hi> confeſſed by <hi>Alphonſus</hi> a Papiſt, <hi>lib.</hi> 1 <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>adverſ. haereſ.</hi> So then either your Doctors, Canons, Councils, &amp; three Popes err, or elſe the bond of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:106559:150"/> marriage may be broken, and the innocent partie divorced may marrie another. Your Religion of Matrimonie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not only repugnant to ours and Jeſus Chriſts, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to your own Canons, Councils, Doctors, and Popes.

                  <p>The ninth point of your doctrine is: you will have <hi>Marriage a Sacrament of the New Teſtament, and that proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that according to the inſtitution of God, unto the which the promiſe of the grace of juſtification is annexed:</hi> ſo <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de matrim. cap.</hi> 2. and the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſaith. But mark, Chriſtian Reader, their ground of this their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. They ſay, the bond of marriage among infidels may be broken: but ſay they, the bond of marriage among the faithful cannot be broken. And they make the cauſe of this difference to be this, becauſe the marriage of Chriſtians is a Sacrament. So they reaſon. Marriage
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:106559:151"/> among Chriſtians is a Sacrament; therefore ſay they, it cannot be broken. But what is their principal ground now, whereby they prove marriage to be a Sacrament? Becauſe (ſay they) the marriage of Chriſtians is a bond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble; therefore it is a Sacrament which hath the grace of Juſtification joyned with it. So mutually one er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror upholds another. Upon the which, I reaſon: If the bond of marriage may be broken for adultery then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Sacrament: this your Church grants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe they make that the ground of this: but the bond of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage may be broken for adultery, as hath been proved before, both by the Scriptures, and alſo by your own Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Councils, Doctors, and Popes: therefore marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is not a Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie, in the Sacraments of the New Teſtament, there are earthly elements: as the water in Baptiſm, the bread and wine in the Supper, and an expreſs form of words preſcribed in the New Teſtament: as in Baptiſm, <hi>I baptize thee, &amp;c.</hi> and in the Supper, <hi>This is my body, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 26. They have their expreſs inſtitution by Chriſt in the ſame, and have the promiſes of remiſſion of ſins, and juſtification annexed to them. But none of theſe things are to be had in marriage. Firſt, no earthly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: next, no form preſcribed in the Word of God: thirdly, no expreſs inſtitution of it as of a Sacrament: fourthly, no promiſe of the remiſſion of ſins, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion annexed unto it. Therefore it cannot be a Sacrament of the New Teſtament properly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if marriage were a Sacrament, and ſuch a Sacrament that ſignified and gave the grace of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it, that is, remiſſion of ſins, then wherefore ſhould your Church forbid all your Clergie from the ſame? And wherefore ſhould ye abſtain from that Sacrament, which is inſtituted of God, to give remiſſion of ſins to you,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:106559:151"/> and to make you acceptable to God? as your doctrine ſaith, <hi>Bellarmin lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de matrim. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 67. Why ſhould ye deprive your ſelf of that thing which may place you in Gods favor, and purchaſe to you remiſſion of ſins? (as ye ſay marriage may do) it is a token that either ye believe not your own doctrine, or elſe prefers whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and adultery, which is condemned of God, to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage which is Gods ordinance, and honorable among all men.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I ſay, if the marriage of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eva</hi> in Paradiſe, and the marriage of all the Patriarchs, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Prieſts, and people in the Old Teſtament, was not a Sacrament, neither is the marriage of Chriſtians in the New Teſtament a Sacrament. For they were ſymbols that repreſented our ſpiritual conjunction with Chriſt, as well as the marriage of Chriſtians in the New Teſtament doth: the which you will not deny. And Pope <hi>Leo</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 92. <hi>That marriage was inſtituted from the beginnning, that they might have in themſelves a Sacrament of Chriſt, and his Church:</hi> but the firſt you grant your ſelves was not a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, therefore neither is the ſecond a Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, that which is filthineſs and pollution, cannot be a Sacrament to give forgiveneſs of ſins: but Pope <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricius</hi> calls marriage pollution and uncleanneſs, <hi>Diſt.</hi> 82. <hi>cap. Propoſuiſti, &amp;c. Plurim.</hi> 8. Therefore it cannot be a Sacrament, if he ſpeak true.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, if marriage be ſuch a Sacrament, as ye ſay, to give remiſſion of ſins, then it ſhould be more excellent then virginity, becauſe virginity hath not this promiſe: but this ye will not grant, therefore it is not a Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, <hi>Durandus</hi> a great Doctor of your Church, ſaith, <hi>Ut Capreolus refert in</hi> 4. <hi>diſt.</hi> 26. <hi>quaeſt. unica, artic.</hi> 3. That marriage is not properly a Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>As for that place in the fifth of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> which ye
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:106559:152"/> quote, where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>This is a great myſtery,</hi> ſpeaking of the mutual du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ies of man and wife. I anſwer: firſt, he calls not marriage this great myſtery, but that band of our conjunction with Chriſt, as he expones himſelf: <hi>This is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a great myſtery:</hi> and then he ſubjoyns, <hi>I ſpeak of Chriſt and his Church.</hi> Secondly, ſuppoſe the old Interpreter doth tranſlate this word <hi>myſtery,</hi> a Sacrament; yet you know (if you know the Greek language) that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is called a ſecret. Thirdly, will you have all theſe to be Sacraments properly, which are called myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the New Teſtament, and which the old Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and your Rhemiſts, tranſlats Sacraments? then ſhal you not only make marriage a Sacrament, but alſo the chief <hi>articles of our faith,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16 <hi>and the Goſpel, Col.</hi> 1. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Theſſ</hi> 27 <hi>and the ſeven ſtars in the Revelation, chap.</hi> 1.20 <hi>and the whore o Babel, and the iniquity of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. Rev.</hi> 17 5 all Sacraments. For they are called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the Greek, and ſome of them are tranſlated Sacraments by the old Interpreter, and your Rhemiſts, as marriage is. I wonder that ye quote <hi>Melancthon,</hi> as though he were of your opinion, ſeeing <hi>Bellarmin</hi> acknowledges plainly, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de matrim. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. <hi>(that he denyes it to be a Sacrament properly, as Baptiſm and the Lords Supper is:)</hi> but only grants that it is a Sacrament in ſome reſpect. But you regard not what ye write, ſo being it may carry any ſhow againſt us The ſame we anſwer to you of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Merchiſton.</hi> They call it a Sacrament, but not in that ſenſe that Baptiſm and the Lords Supper are called Sacraments, taking the word improperlie, and more amply, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confeſſes of <hi>Melancthon.</hi> So here is no diſcord neither betwixt us and Chriſt, neither among our ſelves But in very deed, you are they who are at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord both with Chriſt, and among your ſelves. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide this that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Innocentius, calls the marriage of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:106559:152"/> the Gentils Sacraments,</hi> becauſe you may anſwer that they call them Sacraments improperly as <hi>Melancthon, Zuinglius,</hi> and <hi>Merchiſton</hi> calls marriage a Sacrament improperly. So if they be at variance with us for calling marriage a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo is <hi>Bellarmin lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de ſacram. matrim. c.</hi> 3 and Pope <hi>Innocent cap. gaud. de divort.</hi> at variance with your Church, for calling the marriage of infidels a Sacrament. For as we deny marriage to be a Sacrament at all properly, ſo doth your Church deny the marriage of infidels to be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment properly. But to let this paſs, I ſay, becauſe I will not deceive the Reader, as ye do, with appearances of contradictions through the ambiguity of the words, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus de Caſtro, lib. contra haereſ. verbo nuptiae. haereſ</hi> 3. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus a Soto lectio</hi> 2. <hi>de matrimonio.</hi> two of your Doctors, and ſundry others ſay, <hi>That marriage is not a proper Sacrament of the New Teſtament:</hi> And yet the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> and ſundry others of your Church, ſay the contrary. 2. <hi>Durandus</hi> a great Doctor of your Church, ſaith, <hi>in</hi> 4. <hi>dist.</hi> 26. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 3. <hi>That marriage is not a Sacrament properly.</hi> 3. <hi>Some of your Church held, that carnal copulation in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is a part of the Sacrament: ſome the contrary, that it is neither a Sacrament, nor a part of the Sacrament:</hi> ſo <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> teſtifies, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de ſacram. matrim. c.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 88. 4. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus</hi> and your Canoniſts hold, <hi>That the Sacrament of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage doth not confer grace unto them that receive it.</hi> And yet our common doctrine is contrary this, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> grants, <hi>ibidem.</hi> Laſt of all, <hi>Canus</hi> a learned Papiſt, affirms, <hi>That every marriage lawfully contracted among Chriſtians, is not a Sacrament; but only that which is made by the Miniſter in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain form of words:</hi> the which <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and ſundry others deny. And you are of great diverſity concerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that Sacrament among your ſelves. Theſe are not now ſhows of diſorders and contradictions, but they are ſo true and manifeſt, that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> your chief campion, hath

                  <p>As for your doctrine of merits of works, wherein you ſay, <hi>That a man in the estat of grace doth merit eternal life and glory, and that as well in reſpect of the work it ſelf, as of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and promiſe made unto it.</hi> So <hi>Bellarmin lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic. cap.</hi> 17. yea, that <hi>the works are in vertue equal, and of as great valor as the reward of eternal life is, ſo that there is an equal proportion between the works and eternal life.</hi> And there are ſome of your Church, and thoſe of the learned among you, who have gone further, and affirm, <hi>That the good works of the righteous merits life eternal, in reſpect of the worthineſs and excellency of the work it ſelf, ſuppoſe the Lord had never made a promiſe or covenant,</hi> as <hi>Cajetanus</hi> a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and <hi>Dominicus à Soto,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> reports of them, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de justif. cap.</hi> 19. And <hi>M. Reynold</hi> ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 105. That good works and evil are laid in different ballance: that good works are the cauſe of heaven, as evil works are the cauſe of hell. And <hi>Andreas Vega</hi> ſaith, <hi>in 5 quaeſt. de juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic. That the reward of glory ſhal not be greater then our good works have deſerved.</hi> What blaſphemy is this your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? And ſurely if in any one point of your doctrine you ſhow your ſelves to be men, who not only knows not the holineſs of God, the unſpeakableneſs of that other life, the perfection and infinit vertue of Chriſts merits, the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:106559:154"/> perfection of his Law, and mans infirmity and weakneſs; eſpecially you manifeſt it in this point: For if ye knew any of theſe things, ye would never profeſs ſuch damnable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: For that our works may merit eternal life (as ye ſay) and that not only in reſpect of the covenant, but in reſpect of the work it ſelf, there are five things required. 1. That the work be perfect according to that meaſure of perfection which the Law of God requires, and the whole Law muſt be fulfilled, and that perfectly and continually. 2. The works muſt not be debt; that is, ſuch works as we are bound before to do: For the paying of that duty which we ow already, cannot merit properly a reward: For will you ſay, that for the paying of that which you ow already, you deſerve a reward? 3. There muſt be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and equality between the work wrought, and the reward it ſelf: For if the work be leſs, and the reward greater, then that which is more then the work, is not of merit, but of liberality. 4. The perſons to whom the work is done; muſt be obliged and bound by right to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and recompenſe the worker for the worthineſs of the work, ſo that he is not juſt if he do it not. And laſt of all, the work muſt be our own, and not anothers, and the power our own whereby it is done, and not anothers, ere we can be ſaid properly to merit by the ſame. But all theſe conditions will fail in our works; therefore they cannot be meritorious of eternal life. For as to the firſt, the Prophet ſaith, <hi>That all our righteouſneſs is as a menstrous cloth.</hi> And <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>We all offend in many things;</hi> and none there is that have contained in doing all things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Law in that perfection which it craves of us, as hath been proved before: therefore our works cannot be meritorious of eternal life. And as to the ſecond, all that we can do, or is able to do, we are bound to do it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, by the vertue of our creation and redemption, and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:106559:154"/> his other bleſſings already beſtowed; yea, they oblige us to more then we are ever able to pay, according to that ſaying of our Savior, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. <hi>Even ſo ye, when ye have done all that is commanded you, ſay, We are unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, becauſe we have done that which was our duty to do.</hi> Since therefore it is duty, it cannot be meritorious of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. And as to the third, there is no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween eternal life and our works, the reward by infinit degrees ſurpaſſing the work: and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The afflictions of this life are not worthy of the glory which ſhal be revealed, Rom.</hi> 8 18. Everlaſting life being only the juſt reward of the ſufferings of the Son of God. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>What are all our merits to ſo great a glory, ſerm.</hi> 1. <hi>de an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> And <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſaith, <hi>in vita Antonij, Not ſuppoſe we would renounce the whole world, yet are we not able to do any thing worthy of theſe heavenly habitations.</hi> As to the fourth, the Lord is debtor to no creature: For as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Who hath given him firſt, and he ſhal be recompenſed? Rom.</hi> 11.35. The Lord is all-ſufficient in himſelf, and ſo needs none of your labors, and ſo our works cannot oblige him. And therefore <hi>Augustin</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſerm.</hi> 16. <hi>de verbis Apostoli: God is made a debter unto us, not by receiving any thing from our hands, but becauſe it pleaſed him to promiſe.</hi> And to the laſt, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>What haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? now if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. Seeing therefore all our works are imperfect, and ſeeing we are not able to fulfill the Law, and ſeeing all that we can do, is but our duty, and there is no proportion betwixt eternal life and our works, and that the Lord is debtor to no man, and all our ability of doing is from the Lord only; therefore our works cannot be meritorious of eternal life. Hear further what the Fathers ſay in this point. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuali, c.</hi> 22. <hi>All my hope is in the death of my Lord: his death
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:106559:155"/> is my merit, my refuge, ſalvation, life and reſurrection: my merit is the compaſſion of the Lord, I ſhal not be void of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo long as the Lord of mercies ſhal not want. Origen</hi> who lived two hundred years before him, ſaith, <hi>in Epiſt. ad Rom. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>I ſcarcely believe that there can be any work which may of due demand the reward of God, forſomuch as even the ſame that we can do, think, or ſpeak, we do it by his gift or bounty. Then how can he ow us any thing, whoſe grace did preveen us.</hi> And he ſaith afterward, <hi>That the Apoſtle aſſigns eternal life to grace only. Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, <hi>de bono mor. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Everlaſting life is forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> ſo then it is not merit. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith, <hi>adverſus Pelag. That before God, no man is just;</hi> therefore no man can merit. And again he ſaith, <hi>The only perfection of man is, if they know themſelves to be imperfect: and our juſtice conſiſteth not of our own merit, but of Gods mercy.</hi> I omit the reſt for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Now to your teſtimonies, and reaſon to prove your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of works, which you ſhamefuly abuſe, bringing forth Scripture to cloke your damnable doctrine: unto the which I anſwer ſhortly. That there is a reward laid up with God for the works of every one, be they good, be they evil, and according to their works ſhal they be tryed, and every man ſhal be judged and recompenſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, as the Scripture plainly teſtifieth. But that this reward of eternal life promiſed, is of debt, and not of grace, and that our works are the meritorious cauſe of the ſame, that the Scripture never affirms. For the Lord freely and of his meer grace crowneth his own works in us: and that not for the excellency of the work it ſelf, but of mercy freely for his Chriſts ſake, as both I have proved, and the Fathers have teſtified. So theſe Scriptures ſerve you to no purpoſe. For the controverſie betwixt us, is not whither there is a reward promiſed, and whither it ſhal be rendred accordingly to the ſame, for that we grant:
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:106559:155"/> but whither this reward is of merit or of grace. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith plainly in the 6 of the <hi>Romans, The wages of ſin is death: but everlaſting life is the free gift of God.</hi> And in the 8 of the <hi>Romans,</hi> it is called, <hi>an inheritance.</hi> Now if it be heritage to them that are in Chriſt, and they heirs of it through him, then it is not their merit. As for the 16. of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> it is Apocrypha, and the text hath not that word <hi>merit,</hi> as the old Interpreter whom ye follow tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates it, <hi>but according to his work.</hi> As for the 118. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and the 16 of <hi>Matthew,</hi> ye are over ſeen in the quoting of them, for they have no ſuch thing. As for your reaſon, that a reward hath ever a relation to a merit, that is falſe. For the Apoſtle in the 4. of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſpeaks <hi>of a reward that is imputed freely, not to him who worketh, but to him that believeth in him, who juſtifieth the ungodly, verſ</hi> 5. And in this ſenſe the reward of eternal life promiſed and fulfilled in his Saints, is taken in the Scriptures. And whereas you ſay, that there is no reward promiſed but to doing and working: that is falſe alſo, for there is a reward of eternal life promiſed to the believer, verſ. 5. And as for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of reward made to good works, it is true, it is made to them, but not as though our works were meritorious cauſes of that reward, but only that they are effects to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie of our faith in the merit of Jeſus Chriſt, in whom on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the promiſes are made to us and our works, and for whoſe ſake only they are fulfilled in his Saints. For theſe cauſes therefore is the promiſe of reward made unto works; firſt, becauſe all men by nature are hypocrits, and boaſts of a vain pretence of faith, unto whom <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Show me thy faith by thy works, James</hi> 2.18. to take away therefore this vail of hypocriſie from hypocrits, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are made to works. 2. The promiſe is made to works to ſtir us up to the doing of them: for we would be faint in doing good, if we knew not that the Lord
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:106559:156"/> would reward them. It is true he hath promiſed no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to them who work not, becauſe they in whom Chriſt dwels, they are not only juſtified, but alſo ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and bring forth the fruit of their ſanctification. And this for the ninth point of your doctrine, which is ſo damnable, that both it derogats from the merit of Chriſt, and makes men to take away their confidence from Gods only mercy and free grace: and ſwells them up with a vain confidence of themſelves, and binds as it were, their hearts and mouthes, that they cannot with all their heart render the whole praiſe of their ſalvation to Gods only free grace.</p>

                  <p>TWelftly, we have other works that are called works of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation, which are works of greater perfection, and are not ſet down to us as the commands of God (without the which we cannot be ſaved) but as divine counſels adjoyned thereto, they augment our glory and reward in heaven: which is alſo the doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Chriſt ſaid to the young man, <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go ſell the things thou haſt, and give unto the poor, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and come follow me. Matth.</hi> 19.21. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.21. So we find, that wilful poverty is a work of ſupererogation. Such like, <hi>S. Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.34.38. ſaith, <hi>And the woman unmarried, and the virgin thinks on the things that pertains to our Lord, that ſhe may be both holy in body and ſpirit.</hi> And afterwards: <hi>Therefore both he that joyns his virgin in matrimony doth well, and he that joyns not doth better.</hi> Therefore virginity is a work of ſupererogation: for albeit matrimony be good, yet the other is better: and this was a counſel that <hi>S. Paul</hi> gave, and no command. Such like <hi>Paul</hi> wrought a work of ſupererogation, when
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:106559:156"/> he preached the Evangel <hi>gratis,</hi> where he might have taken juſtly for his labors, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.40. <hi>and</hi> 9.14.15.23.17.18.19. Chriſt our Savior ſpeaks of the ſame works in the parable of the Samaritan, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.35. where he promiſed to the hoſtler to recompenſe him what ever he did ſupererogat upon the wounded man more then the two pennies. And <hi>David</hi> the Prophet did ſupererogat, when he did riſe in the night to give God praiſe, and ſeven times in the day, and ſo forth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.62.164.</p>

                  <p>As though your former doctrine had not injuried the merits of the Son of God, and his free grace enough, with the which (if the Apoſtle be true) your merits of works cannot ſtand. For the Apoſtle ſaith, (ſpeaking of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) <hi>If it be of grace, then it is no more by works, otherwiſe grace were no more grace: and if it were of works, then were it no more of grace, otherwiſe works were no more works, Rom.</hi> 11.6. You yet add this damnable and blaſphemous doctrine to all the reſt. And certainly ſuppoſe ye will not let it fall to the ground, that your doctrine is the <hi>doctrine of the dragon,</hi> and that your Church is that <hi>myſtical Babylon, that mother of whoredoms, full of names of blaſphemie:</hi> yet this your blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous doctrine ſufficiently declares what you are. For I appeal your conſcience, if ye have any unblotted out yet with the ſmoke of the bottomleſs pit, and the conſcience of all men who ever felt the power of ſin in them, and the free grace of God renewing them, whither this doctrine of yours be blaſphemous or not: <hi>That not only you may ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Law, and do all the duty which God hath commanded you, and thereby merit eternal life: but alſo you may do more then God hath commanded, which ye call works of greater perfection then the Law of God requires of us; by the doing of the which, you ſay you merit a greater degree of glory in the kingdom of heaven:</hi> and as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith, <hi>in his preface before de mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>That your religious Monks lives a ſtraiter, and more
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:106559:157"/> high kind of life, then either the Law of God or man hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. And that a man may love God with a greater and more perfect love, then is commanded him in the Law, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>yea, that a man may love God with a greater love, then he is bound to love him: and that theſe works are not only meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of eternal life, and of a ſingular glory in heaven, but alſo are profitable to ſatisfie for our ſins: and that men may communicat of the abundance of theſe their merits unto others.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they have in their ſervice books, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>ſarum,</hi> this form of prayer often, <hi>That by the merits of the Saints they may obtain grace: and by the blood of Thomas (Archbiſhop of Canterbury) they may aſcend to heaven.</hi> All which whither they be not words of blaſphemy, and the doctrine of the dragon, I appeal your conſcience before God in the great day, and the conſciences of all men, as though it were not blaſphemy enough to ſay, that men may merit eternal life, and a greater degree of glory in that life to themſelves by their works: but alſo to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat unto others of the abundance of their works, and ſo not only to be ſaviors of themſelves, but of others alſo. And here, Reader, I am compelled to ſpeak this to thee, ſuppoſe thou believe not that they have written, and will maintain ſo horrible blaſphemies, I wonder not: for I ſpeak the truth to thee in my conſcience, I lie not, I could not have been induced my ſelf to have believed that ever they durſt have profeſſed ſuch damnable and deviliſh doctrine, if I had not read it my ſelf in their own books; yea, I durſt not have been ſo confident as to have ſet it down here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the report of any, except I had read it my ſelf. But if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the pit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Lord deliver his own from ſuch damnable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which of neceſſity muſt bring damnation upon the believers and profeſſors of it.</p>
                  <p>To anſwer you then; firſt, if we be not able to perform
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:106559:157"/> all the duties which God requires of us in his law, then we are not able to do works of ſupererogation, which is more then our duty, commanded in the law, as ye ſay. But the firſt I have proved before: therefore the ſecond is true.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if the Law of God be perfect, and preſcrives more then we are able to do, then there is no works of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation: this you will not deny. But <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Law of God is perfect, Pſal.</hi> 19. and our inability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, I have proved before: therefore there is no works of ſupererogation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, what an abſurd and blaſphemous thing is this to ſay, that God hath no commanded to us the works of greateſt perfection, (for <hi>M. Gilbert</hi> calls theſe, works of greater perfection) and ſo ſuch works wherein he is moſt glorified: but hath left them in our own choiſe, to do, or not to do, as though the Lord had not commanded us to glorifie him in the greateſt perfection, nor yet we were bound to do the ſame?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if there be any ſuch works of ſupererogation which are of greater perfection then the Law commands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then it ſhould follow, that the vow of continency, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful poverty, and monaſtical obedience to their ſuperiors, ſhould be works of greater perfection, and ſo pleaſe God more, then the love of God with all the heart, with all the ſoul, with all the ſtrength, with all the mind, with all the thought, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.2.37. <hi>Mark</hi> 12.29.30 For the former are your works of ſupererogation, and the laſt is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Law: but this is abſurd: therefore there is no ſuch works.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, this was only proper to the Son of God to fulfil the Law of God perfectly, and to do more then the Law required: to wit, to die for us who were his enemies: this doctrine therefore of yours ſpoils him of this his glory.</p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:106559:158"/>
                  <p>Laſt of all, if none can merit eternal life through their works at all, then none can augment their glorie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in heaven by their works of ſupererogation. But the firſt I have proved before: therefore the other muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. And mark this, Reader, how far God hath blinded their minds: for they deride, and they mock at that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the righteouſneſs and merits of Chriſt, and they pronounce them accurſed that ſo think: but yet they teach that the works of ſupererogation which men do, may be communicat to others. <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As for the firſt place which ye quote, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwered to it before, in my anſwer to the ſecond point of your doctrine: to the which I refer the Reader. And ſo your wilful poverty hath no ground here. For if this man did not perfectly fulfill the Law, then was he not able to do more then the Law required of him: But the firſt is true, as I proved before in the ſecond point of your doctrine, and as the circumſtances of the text teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it; for he went away ſad, and he put his truſt in his riches: and ſo it was not only difficile, but impoſſible for him to enter in the Kingdom of God, as our Savior ſaith; which had not been true of him, if he had fulfilled the Law. And this was a ſpecial command to this man, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his hypocriſie. And all Chriſtians are bound alſo out of the love of their heart to Chriſt, to be content to forſake all that they have, before we renounce him, or his Word, when he ſo requireth of us. And if wilful poverty be ſuch a work of perfection, as ye think, wherefore then would the Prophet have prayed, <hi>Prov</hi> 30.8. <hi>Give me neither poverty nor riches, but feed me with food convenient.</hi> And if this be the work of greateſt perfection, what is the cauſe that your Abbots, Popes, Biſhops and Cardinals (For who ſhould be perfect, if not theſe?) will not ſell all
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:106559:158"/> their revenues which they have, wherein they ſurmount the Princes of the world, and ſo augment their glory in heaven, and be perfect? But ſhal others believe and obey this doctrine of yours, when the greateſt Patrons of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves and obeys it not? O hypocrits! who will believe you?</p>
                  <p>As for the next work of ſupererogation, <hi>Virginity:</hi> It is true that the virgin and unmarried, who hath the gift of continency, thinks upon the things that appertains to God: And it is true, that if any have the gift of continency, it is better to be unmarried, then to marry, eſpecially in the times of perſecution. But yet it follows not that it is a work of ſupererogation: For to them who have the gift, it is a commandment: For he that hath the gift, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to uſe it; and in loſing it, he ſins. And every man is bound to glorifie God to the uttermoſt of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and God is moſt glorified by the ſingle life of theſe, eſpecially in the time of pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ecution, who have the gift: And ſo it is not a counſel ſimply, but alſo a command, but to them only who have the gift, and that ſo long only as they have the gift. And the Apoſtle ſaith in that ſame place which ye quote here, that he thinks he hath the Spirit of GOD alſo, and ſo this judgement of his was the judgement of the Spirit of GOD, which binds and obliges all them who have the gift. But unto theſe who have not the gift, the Scripture hath a plain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.3.9. <hi>For the avoyding of fornication, let every man have his own wife, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>if they cannot ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain, let them marry, &amp;c.</hi> And whereas ye ſay that Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is better then Matrimony; that is not true ſimply, but only to them who have the gift. And ſince you ſay it is better, wherefore make ye Matrimony a Sacrament to give remiſſion of ſins? For ſhal not a Sacrament which gives remiſſion of ſins, be better then an indifferent action,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:106559:159"/> which men may do, or leave undone, ſuch as ye ſay Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is? As for the Apoſtles example, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Goſpel freely without wages to them. I anſwer: Suppoſe it was lawful to him, and all the Miniſters of the Goſpel, to have taken wages, as himſelf teſtifies, and proves in that ſame chapter, from the 4. verſe to the 15. yet it was not expedient to him for the courſe of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel among them. And men are not only commanded to abſtain from that which is unlawful, but alſo from the things which are lawful, if they be not expedient: and ſo he did no more here then he ſhould have done. And therefore he ſaith, <hi>It were better for me to die, then that any ſhould take my glory from me,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.15. which cannot be ſaid of theſe works which we are not bound to do. And he ſaith, verſ 8. <hi>That I abuſe not my authority in the Goſpel:</hi> but this would have been an abuſe of his liberty with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: therefore he was bound to do it. And yet we read that he ſpoiled other Churches, as he ſaith himſelf, and took wages from them. And alſo the Church of <hi>Philippi</hi> did communicat unto him twiſe, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>As for the 10. of <hi>Luke,</hi> it appears ye are ſcarce of proofs in quoting this place for your works of ſupererogation: For will you ſay that the <hi>Samaritan</hi> was not bound by Gods law to ware more upon his neighbor in his extremity then two penny worth? Hath not the Law ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbor as thy ſelf?</hi> And are we not bound to lay down our life one for another, much more to ware out for him ſuch things as may ſerve for the comfort of this life in ſuch an extremity? And the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, 1. <hi>John</hi> 3.16. is not to ſupererogat (as ye take it) but to ware out further expenſes. So your blindneſs is groſs in this. And as for that of <hi>David,</hi> in praiſing God night and day ſo often, he was ſo far from thinking of himſelf that he had done more then the Law required of him, that he
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:106559:159"/> never thought of himſelf that he had fully obeyed the Law. And therefore how often prays he in that Pſalm, that the Lord would open his eyes to underſtand the Law, and give him grace to perform the ſame, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.12.17.18.27. And in other Pſalms he ſaith, <hi>My ſins are mo then the hairs of my head, Pſal.</hi> 40.12. And <hi>if thou mark iniquity, who can ſtand, Pſal.</hi> 130.3. And therefore this was no work of ſupererogation. And if you knew, <hi>M. Gilbert</hi> (but the Lord hath blinded you) either the perfection of the Law of God, or our inability to perform it, or the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable love and kindneſs of God, which hath obliged us to mo duties then ever we are able to do: (For when we have done all which is commanded us, yet we are but unprofitable ſervants:) you would be ſo far from defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe your works of ſupererogation, that ye would abhor and deteſt this doctrine.</p>

                  <p>THirteenthly, our doctrine is, that Chriſt our Savior (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſoul) deſcended to the Hells, as we have in our Belief. And this was the doctrine of the Apoſtles: for <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>That God hath raiſed him up, looſing the ſorrows of Hell, according as it was impoſſible that he ſhould be held of it, Acts</hi> 2.24. And this he proves by the Pſalms of <hi>David, Behold, thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) nor give thy holy One to ſee corruption, Pſal.</hi> 16.10. This ſame is the doctrine of <hi>S Paul</hi> alſo; <hi>And that he aſcended, what is it but becauſe he deſcended alſo firſt into the inferior parts of the earth.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellarmin</hi> grants, that <hi>we all agree that Chriſt after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain manner deſcended into hell:</hi> but the whole controverſie is of the ſenſe and meaning of it. We ſay, that he ſuffered the pains of hell in his ſoul upon the croſs, and lay under the bondage of death, and was held captive in the grave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which in the Hebrew is called SCHEOL (which ſignifieth ſometime hell in the Scripture, and ſometime the grave) for the ſpace of three days: and in this ſenſe we grant he deſcended into hell, and in this ſenſe it is taken in our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. But your doctrine is, <hi>That he deſcended locally into hell according to his ſoul; firſt, to give to the ſouls of the Fathers eſſential bleſſedneſs, and to deliver them out of that priſon, and bring them to heaven, Bellarm. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Chriſto, cap.</hi> 16. And this we ſay is neither the meaning of that article of your Belief, neither yet hath it ſo much as a ſyllable in the whole Scripture to warrant it. And as for the article it ſelf, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> confeſſes that this article was not in the Creed with all Churches, as he proves there by the teſtimonies of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus, Origen, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> who all exponed the Creed. And <hi>Auguſtin</hi> exponed it five times, and yet never mentions this article. And <hi>Ruffinus</hi> an ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter teſtifies, <hi>That this article was neither in the Creed of the Roman Church, nor of the Eaſt Churches.</hi> And alſo it is not in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, which is more then 300. years after Chriſt. And <hi>Perkins,</hi> a learned man, in his expoſition of the Creed, affirms, that threeſcore Creeds of the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Councils, and Fathers wants this clauſe. Whereby it is moſt clear that this article was not put in at that time, when the reſt of the articles were gathered together, but hath crept in ſince, and that more then 300. years after the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:106559:160"/> days of the Apoſtles. For <hi>Auguſtin</hi> lived in the 400. years, and the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed was more then 300. years after Chriſt. And yet becauſe it hath continued a long time, and hath been received by the conſent of the Churches of God, and doth alſo carry with it a fit underſtanding and ſenſe, as hath been ſpoken; therefore it is to be retained, but not in that ſenſe as ye expone it.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, if this local deſcenſion of Chriſt, according to his ſoul into hell, were true, and that it were an article of our Faith, as ye ſay, then the four Evangeliſts, which are the ſworn pen-men of the hiſtory of his death and reſurrection, and eſpecially <hi>Luke,</hi> who (as he ſaith himſelf) <hi>Luke</hi> 1 3. <hi>intended to make an exact narration of the ſame,</hi> who alſo did amply ſet down the ſame, with all the circumſtances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they would not have omitted it, being a ſpecial article of our Faith, if your doctrine be true: ſeeing the end of their writing, as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, was <hi>that we might believe, and by believing have eternal life, John</hi> 10.31. But they never mention it, as your ſelves cannot deny. Therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that he locally deſcended into hell.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Scripture makes it plain that Chriſts ſoul was in Paradiſe at that time with the thief: For he ſaith unto him, <hi>This night ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe, Luke</hi> 23.43. For this cannot be meant of his God-head; for it is every where; neither of his body, for it was in the grave. Seeing therefore his ſoul was at that time in Paradiſe, it could not be in hell; except you will ſay that Paradiſe and hell are both one, which I ſuppoſe ye will not ſay.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if the ſouls of the Fathers were not in hell, then Chriſt deſcended not thither: For ye ſay, <hi>That he deſcended thither for that effect to deliver them, Bellar. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Christo, cap.</hi> 16. but they were not in hell, but in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which our Savior calls <hi>Abrahams boſome,</hi> where <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> was: betwixt the which and hell, the Scripture
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:106559:161"/> teſtifies there <hi>is a great gulf, Luke</hi> 16.23. therefore he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended not locally into hell.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, ſome of your own learned Doctors have ſeen this error of yours, and have gone from it, as <hi>Durandus</hi> by name, who affirms, <hi>in</hi> 3. <hi>diſtinct.</hi> 22. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 3. <hi>That Chriſts ſoul deſcended not to hell in ſubſtance, but in vertue,</hi> and proves it by reaſons.</p>
                  <p>And laſt of all, you are at ſuch variance among your ſelves concerning this point, that ſome of you affirms, <hi>That Chriſts ſoul ſuffered pain in hell when it was there;</hi> as <hi>Cajetan in Acts</hi> 2. and <hi>Thomas of Aquin,</hi> 3. <hi>part. quaeſt.</hi> 52. <hi>art.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. two great Papiſts: and yet <hi>Bonaventure in</hi> 3. <hi>diſtinct.</hi> 22. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 4. and <hi>Bellarmin lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Chriſto, cap.</hi> 16. affirms the contrary, <hi>That his ſoul was in the place of pain, and yet ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered no pain.</hi> Next, <hi>Thomas of Aquin</hi> affirms, 3. <hi>part. qu.</hi> 52. <hi>That Chriſt deſcended only into that place of hell, called Limbus Patrum:</hi> but <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is more probable that he went to all the parts of hell.</hi> And this is the conſent which you Papiſts have among your ſelves, not only in this point, but almoſt in all the points of your doctrine. Now as to the places of Scripture which ye quote, they ſerve nothing to this purpoſe. For the 2. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> it ſpeaks of that bondage of the grave which kept him under until he roſe again: and therefore the Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which ſignifieth death, and not hell, as ye tranſlate it here: and <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>whom God raiſed up.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks then of that part of Chriſt which had fallen and was raiſed up: but it was the body only and not the ſoul which fell down, and was raiſed up: therefore he ſpeaks of the ſorrows of death, whereby his body was kept in bondage, and not of any local deſcenſion of Chriſts ſoul. As for the places of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> which ye quote here, <hi>Peter</hi> brings them not in to prove this local deſcenſion (as ye ſay) whereof he makes no mention: but to prove his reſurrection, as he ſaith in the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:106559:161"/> 31. verſe moſt plainly: <hi>He knowing this before,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>David, ſpake of the reſurrection of Chriſt, that his ſoul ſhould not remain in grave, neither his fleſh ſhould ſee corruption.</hi> So, if ye will believe the Spirit of God in the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting theſe places, they ſpeak of the reſurrection of Chriſt, and not of the delivering of the ſoul out of hell; for he was in Paradiſe, as he ſaith himſelf: and it is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that was raiſed, and not the ſoul. And the Hebrew word is NEPHESCH, which not only ſignifieth the ſoul, but alſo the life, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.21. <hi>Let us ſmite his ſoul;</hi> that is, take away his life. And it ſignifieth alſo the body of the dead wherein there was life, as <hi>Levit.</hi> 21.1.11. And this word Hell, is SCHEOL in Hebrew, which moſt uſually is taken in the Scripture for the grave. So then the meaning is this, <hi>The Lord will not leave his Nepheſch;</hi> that is, the body wherein his life was in <hi>Scheol;</hi> that is, in the grave: which ſpeech is uſual in the Scripture. Now as to the other Pſalm 29.3. it is ſpoken properly of <hi>David,</hi> where he thanketh God who had ſaved his life from the hands of his enemies, which by a borrowed ſpeech fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented in the Scripture, is called the delivery of his ſoul from the grave. As for the 4. of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> theſe <hi>lower parts of the earth,</hi> is not Hell, as ye expone it, but the earth it ſelf, which in reſpect of the world, is the loweſt part: and ſo it is taken in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139 15. where <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt faſhioned me beneath in the lower parts of the earth;</hi> where here it is not taken for Hell, as you take it in that place of the <hi>Epheſians;</hi> otherwiſe ye muſt ſay that <hi>David</hi> was born in Hell, which I ſuppoſe ye will not ſay. So hereby is meant then the loweſt and baſeſt degree of his humiliation. So now to conclud this, neither in theſe points, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> nor in any point of doctrine wherein ye differ from us, is your doctrine agreeable to Chriſts doctrine and his Apoſtles, as hath been (I hope) proved
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:106559:162"/> ſufficiently. You muſt therefore provide you for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weapons and armor, and ſtronger defences for the overthrow of our doctrine, and uphold of yours, then ye have done: otherwiſe your ſhots will be but as ſhots of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and your bulwarks but of intempered morter, which ſuddenly will ruſh down at the light of the truth of God. The Lord open your eyes to ſee the truth, and ſuffer you not to continue any longer, to cauſe the blind go out of the way, as you have done. Amen.</p>

                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:106559:162"/> or not, let this my anſwer be a tryal thereof. You are bold enough indeed in affirming it to be impoſſible: but what have ye for you? You ſay, becauſe the difference chiefly that we differ from you, is in denying and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. What a raiſon is this? Can we not prove our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion out of the Scripture, becauſe we deny yours which is contrary to the ſame? Is it impoſſible to prove the truth, becauſe falſhood is denyed and abhorred? What new Logick or Divinity is this? I would never have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that ye had been ſuch an unskilful reaſoner, if your ſelf had not bewrayed the ſame. And certainly your Church is not beholden to you: For if your reaſon hold forth, it will follow that it is impoſſible to you, or any man elſe, to prove the heads of your Religion by the Scripture: For in your Confeſſion of Faith, and form of abjuration ſet down by the Monks of <hi>Burdeaux, anno</hi> 1585. there they deny and abhor the Proteſtants and their doctrine, and compel all men who deſire the fellowſhip of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and their abſolution, to abjure, renounce, and ſubſcribe the ſame. But I ſuppoſe your Church will not allow this manner of reaſoning of yours. And whereas you ſay, that the chief difference wherein we differ from you, is in denying and abhorring, &amp;c. of your Religion. I ask you, Doth not our Religion differ as far from yours, as yours doth from us? This you cannot deny. For are not two contraries equally different one from another? Doth not light differ as far from darkneſs, white from black, Chriſt from Antichriſt, as darkneſs from light, black from white, and Antichriſt from Chriſt? And are not yours and our Religions contrary one to another?

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:106559:163"/> muſt alſo differ from you in the main &amp; ſubſtantial points of our Religion. And ſo the chief difference wherein we differ from you, is not in denying and abhorring, but in the main and fundamental grounds of our Religion. Otherwiſe it ſhal follow that the chief difference that ye differ from us, is in denying and abhorring of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which I think your Church will not digeſt. Whereas you ſay, that this may be ſeen by our Confeſſion of Faith: Our Confeſſion hath not only the deteſting and denying of your abominable errors in general and particular; but alſo the confeſſion of our Faith in general, referring the particular heads thereof to that confeſſion which is rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament. And ſo here, <hi>M. Gilberts</hi> untruth and calumny of our Confeſsion may be ſeen. As for this form of exacting of an oath and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to Religion, if you find fault with it, you not only gain-ſay the Scriptures of God, impaires Princes lawful authority, and the Church of their Juriſdiction and lawful power; the example of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 29.10 and of <hi>Joſua</hi> 24.25. <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the High-Prieſt, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 11.17. <hi>Joſia,</hi> 2. of the <hi>Kings</hi> 23.3. <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.12.

                  <p>As for our ability to prove the truth of our doctrine, I anſwered it before: Judge thou, Chriſtian Reader, of the ſame, by this my anſwer. As for the ſuſpending of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties acts againſt you, that is not in our hands: and for
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:106559:164"/> all the good ye could do, you have but too much liberty. And if you ſpeak no better for your Religion then you have done elſe in this your anſwer, your Church will be but little beholden to you for it. And certainly, if you will bind and oblige your ſelf to face your own cauſe, and defend your Religion by word, I hope that licence of a ſafe paſſage and conduct would be granted to you by his Majeſty, to let you ſpeak for your ſelf, what ye have for you for the defence of it, for that ſpace, without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to your perſon, and that ſurer, and with greater ſafety then <hi>John Hus</hi> had, who notwithſtanding of his ſafe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, yet was burnt.

                  <p>WHom <hi>M. John</hi> calls Fathers here, I know not, except <hi>Simon Magus, Novatus, Aerius, Jovinianus, Pelagius, Vigilantius,</hi> and ſuch. For indeed there is none of theſe, and many the like, but they were againſt us, and with them, in ſome heads. But I am ſure, <hi>S Ireneus, S. Cyprian, S. Ambroſe, S. Augustine, S. Jerome, S. Baſile, S. Chryſoſtome,</hi> with the reſt of the holy Fathers, is no way with them, and againſt us, as <hi>M. John</hi> will not be able to prove for all his offer. As for example, it is a chief ground in their Religion, that only faith juſtifieth. This, I ſay, can neither be proved by the Scriptures, nor ancient Fathers of the firſt ſix hundred years. For why the contrary is expreſly contained in the Word of God. <hi>Do ye ſee</hi> (ſaith <hi>S.

                  <p>As for this calumny of yours, the tryal of it will come in afterward: therefore I refer the anſwer of it to that place. And whereas you ſay, that you know not whom I call Fathers, either your malice makes you to diſſemble your knowledge in this, or elſe palpable muſt your ignorance be. And where you ſay, that <hi>Ireneus, Cyprian, &amp;c.</hi> and the reſt of the holy Fathers are no ways with us, againſt you; and that I will not be able to prove it: I have not only proved that already in ſundry heads of our Religion, but alſo that ſundry of your own Popes, Cardinals, Doctors
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:106559:165"/> Biſhops, Councils, and Canon Law have been with us in ſundry points of our Religion which we profeſs, againſt that which ye profeſs. And as for that example of <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith only,</hi> which ye caſt in, which is one of the chief grounds of our Religion: This I will prove both by the Scripture, and by the teſtimonies of the Fathers of the firſt ſix hundred years.</p>
                  <p>Our doctrine then concerning Juſtification, is this: That as our ſins was not inherent in Chriſt, but imputed to him, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 21. which was the cauſe of his death: ſo his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs whereby we are accounted righteous before God, is not inherent in us, but imputed to us: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>he is made of God unto us righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</p>
                  <p>Next, the only inſtrument that apprehends, and as it were, takes hold of this righteouſneſs of Chriſt, is a lively Faith, which works by love, and brings forth good fruits: ſo that neither is Faith an efficient or meritorious cauſe of our ſalvation (for only Chriſts death and righteouſneſs is that) but only an inſtrument to apprehend the ſame. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is every Faith this inſtrument; but only that living Faith which I have ſpoken of: ſo that true Faith is never without the fruits of good works, no more then fire is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heat: and yet neither are our works, nor the work of Faith it ſelf, the meritorious cauſe of our ſalvation; but only Chriſts death and righteouſneſs: Neither are the fruits of this lively Faith, the inſtrument to apprehend and take hold of Chriſts righteouſneſs, but only Faith it ſelf. This then is our doctrine, which is ſo plainly confirmed by the Scripture, that he muſt be exceeding blind that ſeeth it not.</p>
                  <p>The places to confirm the ſame, are theſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. <hi>We conclud that a man is juſtified by faith, without the works of the law. Rom.</hi> 4.2. <hi>If Abraham were justified by works, then
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:106559:165"/> hath he wherein to rejoyce, but not with God. Epheſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>By grace are ye ſaved through faith, and that not of your ſelves: for it is the gift of God: not by works, that none ſhould boaſt.</hi> And <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9 <hi>I have counted all things loſs, that I might win Chriſt and might be found in him, not having my own righteouſneſs which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God through faith.</hi> And again, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not by the works of righteouſneſs which we had done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us.</hi> Seeing the Scripture ſo expreſly removes all works, both of nature and of grace, both going before Faith, and following after it (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are not ſaved by the works of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which we had done</hi>) and of all men, even of thoſe who were juſtified already and ſanctified, as <hi>Abraham, Paul,</hi> and the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were, from our juſtification and ſalvation, as the cauſes thereof: therefore we are only juſtified and ſaved by a lively Faith, apprehending the righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Scripture not only removes works (as we have ſaid) from the cauſe of our Juſtification and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but alſo aſcribes it to Faith, as in theſe places, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>Whoſoever believeth in him ſhal have eternal life.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 8.48. <hi>Thy faith hath ſaved thee, &amp;c.</hi> And again, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>We are ſaved through faith.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3.4.5. <hi>Man is juſtified by faith.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26.28.30. <hi>God ſhal juſtifie circumciſion of faith, and incircumciſion through faith.</hi> And <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> And leſt ye ſhould ſay, the Scripture hath not by Faith only, read the 8. of <hi>Luke,</hi> and 50. verſe, where our Savior ſaith to <hi>Jairus,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Only believe, and ſhe ſhal be ſaved.</hi> Therefore Faith is the only inſtrument to lay hold on the promiſe of God. And leſt ye ſhould ſay, this was not a juſtifying Faith. I anſwer: This Faith which <hi>Jairus</hi> had, was that ſame Faith which the woman
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:106559:166"/> with the bloody iſſue had: but her Faith not only healed her body, but her ſoul alſo, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.48. which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> grants, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de juſtif. cap.</hi> 17. <hi>pag.</hi> 84. &amp; our Savior teſtifieth, ſaying, <hi>Thy faith hath ſaved thee, &amp;c.</hi> therefore this is a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith alſo. Secondly, ſeeing the Faith of miracles, &amp; juſtifying Faith, is both one in ſubſtance with your Church, as <hi>Bellarmin c.</hi> 5. <hi>l. de juſtif.</hi> &amp; the <hi>Rhemiſts annot. in</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. ſay: &amp; if it be a greater work to work miracles, as they ſay, then to be juſtified: therefore if only Faith ſuffice to obtain miracles, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> grants, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. <hi>pag.</hi> 97. why ſhould not Faith only be alſo ſufficient to juſtifie? For if it ſuffice for the greater work, much more for the leſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Scripture aſcribes our Juſtification to grace, and not to works, and ſo oppones them, that the one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand with the other in the matter of our Juſtification. <hi>We are justified</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>freely by grace, and not by works, Rom.</hi> 3.24. And <hi>to him that worketh the reward is imputed, not according to grace, but to debt: but to him who worketh not, but believeth in him who juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him for righteouſneſs, Rom.</hi> 4.4. And in another place, <hi>If it be of grace, it is no more of works, or elſe were grace no more grace: but if it be of works, it is no more grace, or elſe work were no more work, Rom.</hi> 11.6. Seeing therefore our Juſtification is only of free grace, and grace (if the Apoſtle be true) cannot ſtand with works: therefore our Juſtification is not by works, or elſe it were not of grace: and ſo not at all: and ſo the foundation of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation were overturned. I hope therefore this our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification is plainly warranted by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now to the Fathers, becauſe ye ſay it cannot be proved by them, they ſpeak as plainly as we do. <hi>Origen</hi> hath theſe words, <hi>in epiſt. ad Rom. cap.</hi> 3 <hi>And the Apoſtle ſaith, that the juſtification of faith only ſufficeth</hi> (ſolius fidei) <hi>ſo that he that believeth only is juſtified, ſuppoſe no work be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:106559:166"/> of him. Hilarius, Canon.</hi> 8. <hi>in Matth.</hi> ſaith, <hi>For only faith juſtifieth:</hi> fides enim ſola juſtificat. <hi>Baſilius in homil. de humil.</hi> ſaith, <hi>This is a perfect rejoicing in God, when a man vaunts not himſelf of his own righteouſneſs, but knows himſelf to be miſterful of true righteouſneſs,</hi> ſola autem fide in Chriſtum juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, <hi>and to be juſtified only by faith in Chriſt. Ambroſe in cap.</hi> 3. <hi>ad Rom. &amp; cap.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. ſaith, <hi>They are juſtified by faith only through the gift of God.</hi> And in the 4. chapter he hath thriſe, <hi>by faith only,</hi> ſola fides. And in the 9. chapter alſo, <hi>Sola fides poſita eſt ad ſalutem:</hi> that is, <hi>only faith is appointed for ſalvation. Chryſoſtome in homil. de fide &amp; lege naturae.</hi> ſaith, <hi>The thief believed only and was juſtified.</hi> And in <hi>homil.</hi> 3. <hi>ad Tit. If thou gives credit to thy faith, wherefore brings thou in other things, as though faith only were not ſufficient to juſtifie? Augustin,</hi> it is a known ſaying of his, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>contra duas Epistolas Pelag. cap.</hi> 21. <hi>Works go not before justification, but follow him who is already juſtified.</hi> And in another place, <hi>How vertuous ſoever ye report the ancient righteous to have been, yet their vertue ſaved them not, but the faith of the Mediator, August. de fide &amp; operib. cap.</hi> 14. <hi>Cyrillus Alexandrinus lib.</hi> 10. <hi>in Joan. cap.</hi> 18. ſaith, <hi>Man by faith only ſticks in Chriſt,</hi> inhaeret Chriſto. <hi>Theophylactus in comment, ad Galat. cap.</hi> 3. ſaith, <hi>Only faith hath in it's ſelf the vertue of juſtifying. Bernard ſerm.</hi> 22. <hi>in Cantic. in the</hi> 1200. <hi>age,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Man being juſtified by faith only, ſhal have peace towards thee.</hi> What more plain now could the Fathers ſpeak of Juſtification by faith only? which you will not deny. The Reader may learn how much credit is to be given to you who ſo bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmed that neither Scriptures nor Fathers ſaid with us againſt you. I hope they will try you before they truſt you in time to come. For dare you ſay, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> that I have fained here ought of theſe Fathers, and have not brought in their own words ſpeaking? Deny it if ye dare. Be not ſo impudent and ſhameleſs, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> in your
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:106559:167"/> untruths and lies again: for by this ye will both diſcredit your ſelf and your Religion.</p>
                  <p>As for the 2. of <hi>James</hi> which ye quote here, that <hi>by works a man is juſtified, and not by faith only.</hi> I anſwer: This word <hi>to be juſtified,</hi> is taken in the Scripture two manner of ways. Firſt, to be accounted righteous before the tribunal of God: and in this ſenſe, only a lively faith apprehending the death and righteouſneſs of Chriſt juſtifies us: and of this is the controverſie. Next, it is taken for a declaration of ones righteouſneſs, as in the 3. of the <hi>Romans,</hi> verſ. 4. <hi>That thou may he juſtified in thy words</hi> (that is, declared to be juſt) <hi>when thou judges.</hi> And in this ſenſe it is taken in this place. So that this is the meaning of it. Ye ſee then, <hi>by works man is juſtified,</hi> that is, declared by his works to be juſt, and <hi>not by faith only,</hi> that is, by the profeſſion of his faith in Chriſt. So then <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks not of our Juſtification before God which is by faith only, but of the declaration of our righteouſneſs before men, which he calls Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and that for theſe reaſons. 1. Otherwiſe <hi>James</hi> ſhould be contrary to <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>That a man is justified by faith without works,</hi> which is blaſphemous to think: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of our Juſtification before men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our Juſtification before God is declared and made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. 2. The ſcope of the whole chapter, and whole Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, teſtifies the ſame. For his purpoſe is to caſt down the arrogancy and preſumption of ſuch, who bragged of their Faith, as though the bare profeſſion, that they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Chriſt, were ſufficient to ſave them, ſuppoſe they did not bring forth the fruits thereof. Therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle takes this in hand to prove that they are not juſtified by a dead faith, but only by that faith which brings forth the effects thereof. And therefore he ſaith in the 14. verſe, <hi>What availeth it, my brethren, when a man ſaith he hath faith, when he hath no works? can that faith ſave him?</hi> And in the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:106559:167"/> 18. verſe, <hi>Show me thy faith out of thy works, and I will ſhow thee my faith by my works.</hi> And becauſe it may be ye ſay, this is my commentary, therefore hear how one of your own great and chief pillers, <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin in Jacob.</hi> 2. expones the ſame, from whoſe judgement, I hope, ye will not appeal. <hi>Here he ſpeaks,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of works that follows faith, not according to that ſenſe wherein Justification is ſaid to be the infuſion of righteouſneſs, but according to that ſenſe that Juſtification is called</hi> exercitatio juſtitiae, <hi>the practiſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and confirmation of righteouſneſs.</hi> So if ye will believe him, Juſtification here is taken not for our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God, but for the declaration of our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And ſo the ordinary Gloſs <hi>in Jacob.</hi> 2. exponing that place, writes, <hi>Abraham was juſtified without works by faith only: but nevertheleſs the offering up of his ſon, was a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his faith and righteouſneſs.</hi> What can be more clearly ſpoken by any? Would you have more then this? So then this place of <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks not of our Juſtification before God, and therefore ſerves not to prove this your doctrine. As to the 2 of the <hi>Romans,</hi> v. 13. It is true, <hi>it is not the hearers of the Law, but the doers of it which are juſtified,</hi> if rhere were any who had fulfilled it. But the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluds in the 3. chapter, <hi>all under ſin, both Jew and Gentil:</hi> and therefore gathers that <hi>by the works of the Law no fleſh is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> And ſo we will leave this to you to do, &amp; that alſo in the 19. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſpoken to the young man, <hi>Do the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, &amp;c.</hi> And as for the reſt of the teſtimonies, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to what purpoſe ye have quoted them, except for to make a ſhow of Scripture and teſtimonies. For they ſpeak only of the neceſſity of good works, which as they cannot be ſeparat from true faith, ſo no man can attain to ſalvation without them: becauſe where ever Chriſt dwels by true Faith, not only he juſtifies them, but alſo ſanctifies them, and makes them fruitful in good works. The which
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:106559:168"/> we grant, and therefore do urge the ſame continually, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing for a truth, that <hi>without holineſs no man ſhal ſee God, Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>and that the ax is laid to the root of the tree, and that every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, ſhal be hewen down, and caſt in an unquencheable fire, Matth.</hi> 3.10. They ſpeak not therefore of the efficient or formal, or inſtrumental cauſe of our Juſtification, but of our ſanctification with the fruits thereof, and therefore ſerves not to prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie that is in hand. As for <hi>Augustin</hi> his teſtimony, as you corrupt the Scriptures, ſo do ye his teſtimony alſo: for this was the opinion which was riſen up in the Apoſtles days, as he teſtifies there: for theſe are his words: <hi>That ſome thought that faith only was ſufficient to obtain ſalvation without works, neglecting to live well, and to hold the way of God by good works, and being ſecure of ſalvation which is in faith, had not a care to live well,</hi> as he ſaith. And in the end of that chapter, he concluds the whole matter ſaying, <hi>How far therefore are they deceived, who promiſe to themſelves everlaſting life through a dead faith.</hi> The which error we condemn alſo with you: For we acknowledge the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of good works, as the fruits of a living Faith; but not as the efficient, formal, or inſtrumental cauſe of our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>

                  <head>Maſter John Welſch his Reply.</head>
                  <p>You ſaid a little before, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> that the chief diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence wherein we differ from you, is in denying, abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or deteſting, &amp;c. Now you ſay, that the difference chiefly of Religion betwixt us, is about the underſtanding of the Word of God. How well theſe two agree, let the Reader judge. It is no wonder ſuppoſe you diſſent from your brethren (as I have proved in ſundry points before) ſeeing ye diſſent from your ſelf. It is true indeed, that many of our controverſies are about the right ſenſe and underſtanding of the Scripture: but yet if <hi>Petrus a Soto, Lindanus, Pereſius, Caniſius,</hi> all great and learned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, ſpeak truth, the moſt part of the weightieſt and chiefeſt points of your Religion which are in controverſie between us, are but unwritten traditions, which have not their beginning nor author in the Scripture, and cannot be defended by the ſame. And whereas ye would have us to refer the controverſies about the ſenſe and right meaning of the Scriptures to be decided by the writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the firſt ſix hundred years: we receive their monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and writings gladly: but yet ſo, that we put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them, and the writings of the holy Ghoſt in the Scripture. For as I have proved ſufficiently before,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:106559:169"/> as I hope, that only the Scriptures of God have this prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, to be the ſupreme Judge of all controverſies in Religion, and no other; and the beſt way to learn the ſenſe of the Scripture, is by the Scripture it ſelf: for ſeeing all the Scripture is inſpired of God, therefore it ought to be exponed by God in the ſame. For he who made the Law, can beſt interpret the Law. And the Levits practiſed this in the Old Teſtament, who <hi>exponed the Scripture by the Scripture, Nehem.</hi> 8.8 and the Apoſtles in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, who taught <hi>nothing but that which the Prophets ſaid ſhould come to paſs, Acts</hi> 26.28. And if a Father, yea a Saint, yea if an Angel would preach beſide that which the Apoſtles preached, let him be accurſed. So then, nothing can be a warrant to us of the truth of the ſenſe of the Scripture, but the Scripture it ſelf. And as for the Fathers expoſitions, as they may not be Judge (as hath been ſaid) becauſe they may err, and have erred, as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and your ſelves will not deny: and they diſſent often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one from another in the expoſition of the ſame. So let their expoſitions be taken in ſo far as they agree with the Scripture. For would ye have us aſcribe that unto them, which they themſelves have refuſed, and have aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto the Scriptures only?</p>
                  <p>Hear therefore what <hi>Optatus</hi> the Biſhop of the Church of <hi>Milevitan,</hi> a learned man, who lived about the year of God 369. ſaith, writing againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who claimed to themſelves only the title of the Church of Chriſt, as ye do. They called for a Judge, he brings the Teſtament of Chriſt for a Judge: and ſpeaking to them of a point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that was controverted, whither one ſhould be twiſe baptized or not? He ſaith, <hi>You,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>affirm it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, we affirm it is not lawful; between your ſay it is lawful, and our ſay it is not lawful, the peoples ſouls do doubt and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Let none believe you nor us, we are all contentious men;
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:106559:169"/> Judges must be ſought for: If Christians they cannot be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on both ſides; for truth is hindred by affection. A Judge without muſt be ſought for. If a Pagan, he cannot know the Christian myſtery. If a Jew, he is an enemy to Chriſtianity. No Judge therefore of this matter can be found in earth. A Judge from heaven must be ſought for. But why knock we at heaven, when here we have his Testament in the Goſpel? Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus lib.</hi> 5. <hi>contra Parmenianum.</hi> And he renders a reaſon of this in that ſame Book: <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath dealt with us as an earthly father is wont to do with his children, who fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring left his children ſhould fall out after his deceaſe, doth ſet down his will in writing under witneſs: and if there ariſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate among the brethren, they go to the Teſtament. He whoſe word muſt end our controverſie, is Chriſt. Let his will be ſought in his Teſtament,</hi> ſaith he. <hi>Auguſtin in Pſal.</hi> 21. <hi>expoſ.</hi> 2. urgeth the ſame reaſon of <hi>Optatus</hi> againſt the <hi>Donatiſts: We are brethren,</hi> ſaith he to them, <hi>why do we ſtrive? Our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died not unteſtate: he made a Teſtament, and ſo died. Men do ſtrive about the goods of the dead while their Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be brought forth. When that is brought forth, they yeeld to have it opened and read: The Judge doth hearken, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers be ſilent, the Cryer biddeth peace: All the people is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive that the words of the dead man may be read and heard. He lyeth void of life and feeling and his words prevail. Chriſt ſitteth in heaven, and is his Teſtament gain-ſaid? Open it, let us read. We are brethren, why do we ſtrive? Let our minds be pacified: Our Father hath not left us without a Teſtament. He that made the Teſtament is living for ever, he doth hear our words. He doth know his own word: let us read, why do we ſtrive? Ireneus</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>contra haereſ. cap.</hi> 63. <hi>That the lawful expoſition of the Scripture which hath no peril with it, is according to the Scripture themſelves.</hi> What can be more plain, <hi>M. Gilbert?</hi> And I ask you further. Would you have vs to aſcribe more to the interpretation of the Fathers,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:106559:170"/> then the learned of your Church do? As <hi>Cajetan</hi> a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, <hi>in Praefat. in Comment. in lib. Moſis,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Andradius:</hi> the firſt ſaith, <hi>That God hath not tyed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Scripture unto the expoſition or ſenſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</hi> (If God hath not bound it, as he ſaith, why then ſhould we bind it?) Wherefore there he deſires the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Not to miſlike it, if ſometimes in the expounding of them, he fall into a ſenſe agreeable to the text, though it go against the ſtream of the Fathers.</hi> If he ſpeak truth, then that ſenſe that is agreeable to the text, ſuppoſe it be againſt the ſtream of their expoſitions, is to be received and preferred before them. And <hi>Andradius</hi> that learned man, ſaith, <hi>That the Fathers ſpake not Oracles, when they exponed the Scriptures, but might therein be deceived, Defenſ. fid. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. lib.</hi> 2. And he ſaith more, <hi>That the overſights of the tranſlation which they followed, must needs cauſe them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to miſs the meaning of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And yet you would have the ſenſe of the Scriptures to be decided by them, who ſometimes have miſſed the meaning of the holy Ghoſt. And he concluds in the end, <hi>That the holy Ghoſt is the only and faithful interpreter of the Scriptures.</hi> Thus the faireſt flowers of your garden, and chiefeſt pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of your Faith have written: So that if they ſpeak true (whom I know not if ye will preſume to contradict) the expoſition of the Scripture is not tyed unto the expoſition of the Fathers: and it is lawful to go with the text, againſt the ſtream of their expoſitions.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you ſay, if I will be as good as my word, the matter will ſoon be ended: I am glad of it, if you think as you ſpeak. My word was, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> as your ſelf hath written it, that there be very few points of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie between us, wherein I will not get ſome teſtimonies of ſundry Fathers of the firſt ſix hundred years, proving with us againſt them (meaning your Church.) And I
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:106559:170"/> deſired any man to ſet me down any weighty point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, one or mo, and he ſhould have the proof of it. Theſe were my words. Now ye ſay, if I will be as good as my word, the matter will ſoon be ended. Whither I have been as good as my word in this or not let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judge. And I appeal your conſcience, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord in the great day, whither it be true or not. For not only in that example of Juſtification, which ye caſt in, but almoſt in all the heads which are debated among us, I have brought in ſundry teſtimonies of ſundry Fathers with us againſt you. Yea, I have been better then my word in that: For I have brought in teſtimonies of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry that lived after the ſix hundred years: and not of theſe only, but alſo teſtimonies of ſundry of your own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Jeſuits, Cardinals, Biſhops, Canons, Councils and Popes, proving with us in ſome points againſt your ſelves. I look therefore, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> that ye ſhal be as good as your word, and that the matter ſhal end here between you and me. For both you have ſaid, that the matter would ſoon end, if I were as good as my word; and alſo ye have promiſed and ſubſcribed with your hand, to reform your Religion in all things wherein it is not conform to their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies. The which if you do, then muſt you renounce the ſupremacy of your Pope, the ſacrifice of your Maſs, your Tranſubſtantiation, your Juſtification by works, your Merits of works, your perfect fulfilling of the Law of God, your erroneous opinions that the Church cannot err, that the Scripture ſhould not be Judge, with ſundry others. For in all theſe I have brought the teſtimonies of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Fathers: and in ſome of them the teſtimonies of your own Doctors, Councils, Canons and Popes, with us againſt you. Either therefore take ſhame and falſhood for ever more upon you, or elſe keep your word and your writ which ye have ſubſcribed here, and reform theſe
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:106559:171"/> points of your Religion. As for that calumny wherewith ye charge us to have taken away a great part from the Scripture. I know you mean the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> which bears not the mark and ſtamp of Gods Spirit, as being neither written by Prophets, nor yet the moſt part of them in the prophetical language the Hebrew tongue, wherein all the Old Teſtament was written, except ſome things of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> and <hi>Ezra,</hi> which were written in the Chaldaick lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which was known then to the Jews; nor yet recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as Canonical by the Church of the Jews, which your<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Bellar. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>10.</hi>

                  <p>Where this is written, <hi>M John</hi> tells not. For I am ſure, as it is ſet down here, there is no ſuch thing in our Bibles, no not in their own corrupted Bibles, except they have augmented them of new. That there ſhal be an univerſal defection, it is altogether repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Word of God, as I have ſhewed before, in proving the Church always to continue. For the ſame place where I believe he alledges to, hath theſe words; <hi>And it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them: And power was given him upon every tribe and people and tongue, and nation, and all that inhabit the earth adored it, whoſe names be not written in the book of life of the Lamb, Rev.</hi> 13 7.8. Here any man may ſee that the Saints of God that ſhal be perſecute by the Antichriſt, &amp; ſuch that is written in the book of life, ſhal not make defection, then it ſhal not be an univerſal defectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And alſo <hi>M. John</hi> afterward in finding ſome of his Religion that ſaid againſt the Antichriſt the Pope, the time bygone, is contrary to himſelf here, that the defection ſhal not be univerſal.

                  <p>You fight againſt your own ſhadow, <hi>M. Gilbert:</hi> and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:106559:172"/> whereas ye can find nothing juſtly to quarrel in my words being rightly taken, and taken as the Scripture takes them: you deviſe a meaning of your own brain, and would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it upon me, that ye may the more eaſily have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to ſpeak againſt. For I neither ſpake it, nor meant it, that the elect ſhould make defection in the time of the Antichriſt. I am ſo far from it, that ſuppoſe I believe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly that this propheſie is fulfilled in your own Church, yet I know aſſuredly that the Lord reſerved his own elect to himſelf, who was kept free from your Idolatry, as he promiſed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. and Hiſtories record of ſome, whereof I did ſet down ſome of their names. But this is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of one of your own Church, <hi>Dominicus a Soto in lib.</hi> 4. <hi>ſent. diſt.</hi> 46. <hi>quaest.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 1. who believed it aſſuredly, <hi>That the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, and Religion, ſhould be utterly extinguiſhed through the perſecution of the Antichriſt,</hi> if <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſpeak true of him, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Rom. Pont. cap.</hi> 17. And ſo turn the point of your ſword, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> upon your own brother, who ſo taught, and not upon me, who is far from it. And if ye will ſay, wherefore then called I it univerſal? I anſwer: Becauſe the Scripture calls it a <hi>defection,</hi> without any addition or reſtraint: and your <hi>Rhemists</hi> grant, <hi>That this defection ſhal be a revolting of Kings, People, and Provinces, and the publick intercourſe of the faithful with the Church of Rome ſhal ceaſe:</hi> And that <hi>the dayly ſacrifice ſhal be aboliſhed most univerſally throughout all Nations and Churches of the world, by Antichrist himſelf, Annot. upon</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. And <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. <hi>That he ſhal be Monarch of the whole world.</hi> Therefore this Kingdom by your own confeſſion ſhal be univerſal: and ſeeing his Kingdom is an apoſtaſie or defection; for as many as ſhal obey him, ſhal make defection from the faith: therefore by the doctrine of your own Church, it muſt be an univerſal defection. And the Scripture ſaith
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:106559:173"/> expreſly, <hi>That he ſhal make all, both ſmal and great, &amp;c. to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a mark on their right hand, and on their fore-heads: and that no man may buy or ſell, &amp;c. and that all Nations have drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, Rev.</hi> 13.16. <hi>and</hi> 14.8 <hi>and</hi> 18.3. Now whither I might call that <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,</hi> which the Scripture calls <hi>all,</hi> and your <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> makes ſo general and univerſal, that it ſhal poſſeſs all the Kingdoms of the earth, let the Chriſtian Reader judge. And let me ask you, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> Do you not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Church is Catholick, or Univerſal? And do you not think with one of your own number, to wit, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterus</hi> a Jeſuit, <hi>in Enchirid.</hi> that the Church is called Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal becauſe <hi>the faith of the Church is ſcattered in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi> and yet for all this, all particular Nations, and all particular men receives not this faith, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is Univerſal, and is called Univerſal ſtill. And doth not the Scripture propheſie, that <hi>in Abraham all the Nations ſhal be bleſſed, Gal.</hi> 3.8. and yet for all this, there were and is, millions of the Gentils that are not bleſſed in him? Why then, in like manner, may not the defection in the time of the Antichriſt be called univerſal, although the elect be exeemed from it? But wherefore inſiſt I to refute this vain quarrelling of words, which ſerves to no purpoſe? So then, this that I ſaid is both in your Tranſlation, and ours in ſubſtance, and is not contrary to that which I ſaid afterward.</p>
                  <p>As for that place of Scripture which ye cite here, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.7 8. it is not ſpoken here of the Antichriſt, but of the perſecution of the Roman Emperors. As for that calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of yours, in calling our Bibles corrupted and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: this is your ſin, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> whereof one day ye ſhal make an account to the Majeſty of God, for the ſlandering and bearing falſe witneſs of the truth of God. And to ſpeak the truth, this is true of you: For both you have
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:106559:173"/> added to the Scriptures of God: firſt, the <hi>Apocrypha;</hi> next, <hi>your traditions,</hi> which your Church hath decreed to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with equal reverence and godlineſs with the Scripture, Concil. Trident. ſeſſ.</hi> 4. thirdly, <hi>the Decretal Epiſtles of your Popes,</hi> which ſome of you have reckoned in the number of the Canonical Scripture, <hi>Gratianus diſt.</hi> 19. <hi>&amp; Alphonſus de genero. in theſauro Chriſt. Relig. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>num.</hi> 5. And alſo you have corrupted the Scriptures of God by your corrupt tranſlation, eſpecially that of the Colledge of <hi>Rhemes.</hi> The which to be true, if time would ſerve, I might ſoon be able to prove, which hath been ſufficiently proved by that learned and worthy man of God <hi>Doctor Fulk;</hi> unto the which, you, nor all your Clergy, have not anſwered as yet, for ought I know, nor never is able to do.</p>
                  <p>And as for the laſt point, wherein ye ſay, that the text is otherways then I ſet down, let the Chriſtian Reader judge whether my words be one in ſubſtance with this text, or not: For ſuppoſe this be ſet down in the preterit-time, and I ſpake it in the future time, yet it is a propheſie of a thing to come: and your Church grants it is not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled yet, therefore they are both one in ſubſtance. And as for your expoſition, where you expone this of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the people that have obeyed her, and not of their ſin in communicating with her Idolatry, that is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly againſt the text. For this is ſet down here as the cauſe of her puniſhment, which is pronounced before in theſe words, <hi>Babylon is fallen, &amp;c.</hi> Now the reaſon, <hi>becauſe all Nations have drunken of the wine of the wrath of her fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> whereby in the Scripture is ſignified Idolatry; and it is called, the wine of the wrath, &amp;c. becauſe her fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion provoked God to wrath. And <hi>Aretas</hi> exponeth this fornication, <hi>a defection from every good.</hi> And in the 18. chapter it is more evident, where after the denunciation of her fall, this reaſon is ſubjoyned, <hi>Becauſe all Nations have
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:106559:174"/> drunken of the wine of the wrath, &amp;c. and the Kings of the earth have committed fornication with her: and the marchands of the earth are waxed rich through the aboundance of her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi> The which as they cannot be underſtood of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but of the defection; ſo this drinking cannot be underſtood of their puniſhment, but of their communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with her Idolatrie: And yet however it be, this proves that univerſal defection, of the which I ſpake.</p>

                  <p>It is a wonder to hear the Word of God abuſed, not only with falſe expoſitions repugnant to the words ſelf, but alſo alledging the word falſly. For the text of <hi>S. John</hi> hath but this (for he notes no place, becauſe he knowes it may not abide a tryal) <hi>And the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fled unto the wilderneſs, where ſhe had a place prepared of God, that there they might feed her a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes.</hi> Here there is no word that ſhe ſhal be latent, nor lurk, nor be ſecret. And if <hi>M John</hi> will mean that the fleeing to the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is nothing but to be inviſible, and to ly ſecret, then it muſt follow that the whore of <hi>Babylons</hi> ſelf muſt be inviſible and ſecret. For the ſame <hi>S John</hi> ſaith, <hi>And the Angel took me away in ſpirit into the deſert, and I ſaw a woman ſitting upon a skarlet colored beaſt, full of names of blasphemy, having ſeven heads and ten horns.</hi> This word <hi>(deſert)</hi> ſignifies more properly to be ſecret or inviſible, then the word <hi>(wilderneſs.)</hi> It is true appearantly, that if this woman ſignifie the Church of Chriſt, that in the time of the Antichriſt ſhe ſhal be redacted to a ſmal number, as it were in a wilderneſs, and ſhal not poſſeſs every Nation, as ſhe had wont to do: but that ſhe may be made inviſible, and not to be ſeen, there is no true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick that expones it ſo. And ſuch like, this time ſhal be but ſhort, that is, for 1260. dayes, as the text ſaith, which is but three years
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:106559:174"/> and an half. And if <hi>M. Johns</hi> Church had been but ſo long inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we ſhould have diſpenſed with the ſame.

                  <p>All that you can find fault with here, is this, that I ſaid, the Church in the time of the Antichriſt, ſhould be latent, and lurk, and be fed ſecretly; the which hath ſtirred you up in ſuch a choler, that you have cryed out with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I have abuſed the Scripture, &amp;c. Now tell me, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> whither is it becauſe theſe ſame words are not found in the Scripture, or becauſe the doctrine it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be warranted by the ſame? If the former, then I ſay you are but a quarreller about words. And all the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which ye have ſet down in this your anſwer, is not ſet down in ſo many termes in the Scripture, and yet ye will have it to be the doctrine of Gods Spirit (ſuppoſe it be not ſo.) So it ſufficeth that this which I ſaid be warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Scripture, ſuppoſe the ſame termes be not found. If the other, then I ſay, beſide other places of Scripture, this ſame place which ye quote here confirmes the ſame. For know ye not that the wilderneſs is a place of refuge and ſecrecie, from the tyranny of their purſuers? And they that flie to the ſame, they flie to lurk there, and to be kept cloſe and ſecret from the rage of their perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for the ſafety of their lives. So while it is prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, <hi>That this woman</hi> (whereby is ſignified the Church) which ſuppoſe ye conditionally expone ſo: yet <hi>Sanderus</hi> 40. <hi>demonſtrat.</hi> one of your own number, expones it to be <hi>the Church without all doubt ſhal flie in the wilderneſs from the face of the dragon, and that for her ſafety, and there be fed. &amp;c.</hi> Is it not then manifeſt that ſhe ſhal be ſecret and lurk then,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:106559:175"/> and not be ſo open and viſible as ſhe was before? And if this be an abuſe of the Scripture, then not only your ſelf hath abuſed it, but alſo ſundry of your own Church, as the <hi>Rhemists, Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Sanderus.</hi> For your ſelf ſaith, <hi>That in the time of the Antichrist, ſhe ſhal be redacted in a ſmal number, as it were in a wilderneſs, and ſhal not poſſeſs every Nation, as ſhe had wont to do.</hi> For what is this elſe but to lurk and be latent, and to be fed ſecretly, in compariſon of that eſtat wherein ſhe was before? And therefore the only thing that I inferred on this in the end, was, that no man ſhould think that the Church of God was ever open and viſible, in ſuch a flowriſhing eſtat as it is now. And the <hi>Rhemiſts annot. in</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> ſay, That in the time of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, <hi>this great defection or revolt ſhal be of Kingdoms, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Provinces, from the open external obedience and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of Rome. So that their communion with her ſhal be in heart, and the practiſe thereof in ſecret, and he ſhal aboliſh the publick exerciſe of all Religions, true or falſe, ſave that which is done to himſelf: So that the Maſs,</hi> they ſay, <hi>ſhal be had but in ſecret then.</hi> And <hi>Bellarmin lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Rom. Pont. cap.</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. and <hi>Sanderus demonſt.</hi> 35. <hi>&amp;</hi> 37. is of the ſame mind, <hi>That his cruel perſecution ſhal ſtay all publick exerciſe of Religion, and he ſhal make open warfare with the whole Church, and ſhal endeavor to deſtroy the univerſal eſtat of the whole Chriſtian Commonwealth, and ſhal ſhut up the door of Sacraments, and ſhal ſuffer no man any more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Church of Chriſt, and ſhal be Monarch of the whole world.</hi> Now if this be true, whether ſhal the Church of Chriſt by your own doctrine be fed ſecretly, or not be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and lurk, in the time of the Antichriſt? let all men judge. But what a contradictorious ſpirit is this of yours, who to gain-ſay the thing that I writ, cares not to involve your ſelf in a contradiction, not only to the truth, but alſo to your own Catholicks. Either therefore wonder at your
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:106559:175"/> own Catholicks, who have ſpoken as much and more in this point then I did, and at your ſelf alſo, who grants as much in ſubſtance as I meant, that ye and they have abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Scripture, or elſe leave off to wonder at me, and wonder at the vail which is hung over your own eyes, which hinders you not only to underſtand the truth, but alſo to underſtand what your ſelf and your own brethren teach. Now as for your reaſon, it is not ſaid that <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> was in the deſert, but <hi>that John was taken in the ſpirit;</hi> that is, raviſhed in the ſpirit (as in the 1. and 4. chapter) <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the deſert;</hi> that is, into a ſolitar and heavenly contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that viſion which was afterward ſhown him. For as this carrying of him in the ſprit, ſignifies his ſpiritual ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing, ſo this <hi>deſert</hi> ſignifies the ſolitarineſs of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. And as <hi>that lifting up of Ezekiel by the locks of the hair of his head between the heaven and the earth, and that carying of him to the door of the innermoſt port towards the North, to ſee the abominations of Jeruſalem,</hi> was only in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and not bodily. So I take this carrying of <hi>John</hi> in ſpirit to the wilderneſs, to ſee the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to have been in viſion only, and not bodily. And whereas ye ſay that this word <hi>deſert,</hi> ſignifies more properlie to be hid and inviſible then the word <hi>wilderneſs;</hi> I pray you, tell me, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> what is between <hi>deſert</hi> and <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> ſave that the firſt is driven from the Latin, and the ſecond is Engliſh? Muſt you be ſet to the Grammar-ſchool again? What fancie is this wherewith ye are poſſeſſed, that you put a difference between <hi>wilderneſs</hi> and <hi>deſert?</hi> Is there any difference, if you underſtood the Greek language, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>; that is, between <hi>deſert</hi> and <hi>deſert, wilderneſs</hi> and <hi>wilderneſs?</hi> And if ye have ever read the New Teſtament in Greek, there is but the ſelf-ſame word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in both theſe places, which ſignifieth <hi>deſert</hi> or <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</hi> But where have you been when ye did imagine
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:106559:176"/> this difference? Appearantly ye have been dreaming in ſome wilderneſs, or elſe wandring in the wilderneſs of your own blind imaginations. As for the expoſition of your true Catholicks, we count not much of them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways theſe whom ye call your true Catholicks <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> the <hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> and <hi>Sanderus,</hi> have been plain in this matter, and have ſpoken more in this point then we do. And as for the time of this her ſecrecie and lurking 1260 days, which you expound literally to be but three years and an half. I anſwer, This expoſition of yours is againſt: firſt, the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of propheſies, which are expounded figuratively, and not literally, as theſe 70. weeks in <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning Chriſt, where there a day is put for a year. Next, it is againſt the whole circumſtances of the text: For will you expound this <hi>woman</hi> figuratively for the Church, as <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derus</hi> doth: and the <hi>wilderneſs</hi> unto the which ſhe fled, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively for the ſmal number whereunto ſhe ſhal be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacted, as you do; and the <hi>ſun wherewith ſhe was clad, and the moon which was under her feet, and the twelve ſtars that was upon her head, and the red Dragon which purſued her with ten heads, &amp;c.</hi> all figuratively? and yet will ye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the time of her being in the wilderneſs literally? What violence is this which ye will offer unto the holy truth of God, to expound all the reſt figuratively; and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the time literally? So then a day here is ſet for a year, as alſo it is taken in the ſame ſenſe in the 2. chapter of the <hi>Reve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As for the inviſibility of our Church, becauſe that queſtion comes afterward, therefore I omit it now. Only this, as your Hierarchie and abomination of your Church grew, ſo did the purity of the doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt in his Church decay. And as your Popes came not to their hight at an inſtant, and brought not in
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:106559:176"/> their abominations at an inſtant, but piece and piece, and by long proceſs of time: So the purity of the truth of God decayed not at an inſtant, but piece and piece and by a long proceſs of time. For the degrees of your exalting, was the degrees of the depreſſing of the truth of God in his Church. As for our diſpenſation, ſuppoſe your Church uſeth not to give them without money laid down, yet we will neither buy them, nor have them for nought. So keep your diſpenſations at home <hi>(M. Gilbert)</hi> while we ſend for them.</p>

                  <head>Maſter John Welſch his Reply.</head>
                  <p>It appears to you that I have found ſome new Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, other then that of <hi>S. John.</hi> So did it appear to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul taught all men every where againſt the Law of Moſes, Acts</hi> 21.28. and yet it was the truth, as he himſelf teſtifies, <hi>he ſpake nothing beſide that which Moſes and the Prophets fore-told was to come, Acts</hi> 26.22. So every appearance is not truth. It is but the ſcales that are upon your eyes, that makes this ſo to appear to you. For the Scripture of God, and this Revelation of <hi>S. John,</hi> is ſufficient to us to make it manifeſt, that your head is the Antichriſt, and your doctrine is that Apoſtaſie that was propheſied to come, ſo that we need no new revelations, as ye do: For becauſe the revelations already made by God to his Church, and written in his holy Scripture, doth not warrant your abominable and falſe doctrine, and your Popes ſupremacy, which is the foundation of all: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you and your Church flies to unwritten traditions, and fained revelations to prove the ſame. As for example, becauſe your Church hath not ſo much as a ſyllable in the whole Book of God, to prove that <hi>Peters</hi> ſeat was tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Antiochia</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the whole founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Popery: Therefore your Pope <hi>Marcellinus</hi> in his Canon Law, <hi>cauſa</hi> 24. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 1. <hi>cap. Rogamus.</hi> grounds the certainty of this upon a fained revelation, <hi>that Peter by the commandment of God did tranſlate it.</hi> But to leave you with your new revelations, what have ye for you for this your appearance? You ſay, firſt, becauſe I note no place: and next, becauſe theſe words of mine are no wayes in <hi>S. John:</hi> therefore ye conclud it to be an invention of my own. As to the firſt: Is this a good reaſon, I note not the place, therefore I have found out ſome new revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? You muſt be ſent to the Logick ſchools again, to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:106559:177"/> learn the right manner of reaſoning. I noted no place; <hi>Ergo,</hi> I could not: that will not follow. As to the ſecond, my words are no wayes found in <hi>S. John: Ergo,</hi> I have found a new revelation. But what if the ſenſe be found? What if the ſelf-ſame doctrine be found in <hi>S. John,</hi> ſuppoſe not in the ſame words? Then it will not follow that I have found out a new revelation, or that this is the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my own brain. This place which ye quote here, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3. ſufficiently confirms all that I ſaid. For your ſelf will not deny, and <hi>Bellarmin lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6 the <hi>Rhemiſts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. in Apoc. cap.</hi> 11. and <hi>Sanderus</hi> in his Demonſtrations, grant, that theſe two Witneſſes are they who ſhal preach in the time of the Antichriſt, ſuppoſe they expound them of <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> and that they ſhal be perſecuted, and put to death by him. What a blindneſs is this, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> that hath overfyled your eyes, that for the writing of that ſame doctrine which the Scripture warrants, your Divines grant, and your ſelf will not deny, you have ſaid, that it appeared to you that I have found out ſome new revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But judge thou (Chriſtian Reader) what thou may preſume upon <hi>M. Gilberts</hi> appearances. But you ſay, this agrees not with my purpoſe, and that becauſe of the differences between theſe two Witneſſes, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Firſt, I do not mean by theſe two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes the Miniſters of <hi>Scotland</hi> only, but the Miniſters of all the Reformed Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> who have depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of your <hi>Babel,</hi> and have ſhaken off the yoke of the tyrannous bondage of your Head, the Man of ſin: and not only theſe who now live, but theſe alſo who now reſt from their labors, and ſleep in the Lord, of whom a great many were perſecuted, and put to death by your ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, for ſpeaking againſt your abominations. Now as to theſe differences which ye mark, the fountain from the which this ſprings, is your miſtaking of the propheſies of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:106559:178"/> God, and exponing them literally; which according to the uſe of propheſies, and eſpecially theſe which are ſet down in this <hi>Revelation,</hi> and all the circumſtances of this text, ought to be exponed figuratively. Theſe ſame two Witneſſes are called <hi>two Olives, two Candleſticks;</hi> and it is ſaid of them, <hi>that fire comes out of their mouthes, and deſtroys their enemies, Rev.</hi> 11.4.5.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you will not be ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and ridiculous, as to expone theſe things literally, but figuratively; otherwiſe ye will make them monſters, trees, and candleſticks: why then do ye expone this place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their number, work, time, apparel, &amp;c. literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not figuratively, as the reſt of their works and properties muſt be exponed? the which if you had done, then would you have ſeen no difference between the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel that reſiſted your Pope, and theſe two Witneſſes here: but the one to be the propheſie of the other, and the other to be the accompliſhing of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie. As for their number then, they are ſaid to be but two, that is, few; and yet ſuch a ſufficient number, as may prove and qualifie any thing by the Law. For by the Law, <hi>Out of the mouth of two or three witneſſes, ſhal every word be establiſhed.</hi> So the Miniſters of the Goſpel, in the time of your Antichriſt and darkneſs, was but few at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and yet ſo many, as ſerved for to eſtabliſh the truth of God by their teſtimony, in the conſciences of ſo many whom God had appointed to ſave. As for their work of propheſying, the Scripture calls preaching, propheſying, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>and</hi> 13. <hi>and</hi> 14. And the <hi>Rhemists annot. in</hi> 11. <hi>Rev.</hi> grant, that theſe Witneſſes ſhal preach againſt the Antichriſt. And whereas you ſay, that we fore-tell oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times things that is not true: this is your calumnie and lie, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> and ſo ought to have no credit. And the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of the Miniſters of this land againſt your Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kingdom, ye have found by experience, that they
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:106559:178"/> have been too true. And their propheſies are truer then the propheſies of one of your Popes <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> who openly in the pulpit on the ſecond holy day in Eaſter week, in the preſence of diverſe Biſhops, and Cardinals, and of the people and Senat of <hi>Rome,</hi> propheſied, <hi>That the King whoſe name was Henry, ſhould die before the feaſt of Peter next enſuing: or at the leaſt that he ſhould be ſo dejected from his Kingdom, that he ſhould not be able any more to gather above the number of ſix Knights.</hi> And this he preached with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, <hi>Never accept me for Pope any more, if this propheſie be not fulfilled, but pluck me from the altar.</hi> But he was a falſe Prophet in the ſame, for neither was fulfilled. And whereas ye ſay, if they propheſie at any time, it is of evil, and not of good: ſo ſaid <hi>Achab</hi> of the Prophet of the Lord, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 22.8. and therefore he hated him: ſo you ſpeak with the ſame ſpirit againſt us, that <hi>Achab</hi> ſpake with againſt the Lords Prophet. And what good can be ſpoken of your <hi>Babel,</hi> ſince the Lord hath fore-told the ruine of it, &amp; in part hath been accompliſhed? And ſome of your own number, as <hi>Hildegar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, Briget, Catherine de Sens,</hi> have fore-told of the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of your Church, &amp; the reformation of the Church of Chriſt. As for the time, it was ſpoken of before; and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ye have thought it too long, and yet be in patience, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> for it muſt continue, and your <hi>Babel</hi> muſt down. As for the clothing of ſackcloth, it was the apparel of ſuch as was in dolor and in mourning; whereby is ſignified the ſorrow and dolor that ſhould ariſe to the true Miniſters of Chriſt through the perſecution of the Antichriſt &amp; his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, &amp; their idolatrie and abominations. The which hath been ſo clearly fulfilled in the Preachers of the Goſpel ſince <hi>John Hus</hi> his dayes, and before alſo, even to this day, that he muſt be blinded of the Lord who ſees it not. And whereas ye caſt up the clothing of the Miniſtry in this land, ye have forgotten your ſelf, and your Clergy, and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:106559:179"/> your Head the Pope, with his triple Crown, with all the rable of his Prelats, Abbots, Biſhops, Cardinals, &amp;c. as full of riotous pride and pomp, as ever were the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings. See <hi>Bernard. de confid. ad Eugen. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Platin. de vita Pontif. in Paulo</hi> 2.</p>

                  <p>The pomp and glory of whoſe Court, doth ſurmount all the pomp and glory of all the Princes in <hi>Europe,</hi> as ſome that have ſeen it reports. How then can ye juſtly quarrel our attire? Can you ſay that we paſs the bounds of that modeſty and comelineſs which the Apoſtle requires in the over-ſeers of the Church of Chriſt, ſeeing you will have all the outward pomp and glory of your Popes and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according as it was propheſied of you, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. to be comprehended within the definition of comelineſs and modeſtie? But you are like the <hi>Lamians,</hi> of whom it is reported, that they had but one eye, and when they went forth, they took it with them to look upon others, and when they came in their own houſes, they laid it beſide them: You look to your neighbors, but ye over-ſee your ſelf. So for all the differences which ye have yet aſſigned, it remains ſure, that by theſe two Witneſſes here, are ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the Miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>

                  <p>But note here, I pray you, how well theſe new Evangeliſts agree
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:106559:179"/> in the expoſition of this <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>S. John</hi> (for all their grounds &amp; proofs is upon propheſies and dark ſpeakings.) Young <hi>Merchiſton</hi> in his book upon the <hi>Revelation, chap.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ</hi> 3. expones theſe Witneſſes to be the Old and New Teſtament, as he proves in the 21. Propoſition, and <hi>M. John</hi> will have them the Miniſters. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſton</hi> ſaith, that to be clad in ſackcloth, is to preach the Word of God with the obſcurity of mens traditions, and colored gloſſes: <hi>M. John</hi> ſaith here, that the ſackcloth ſignifies perſecution for the preaching of the Word. The notes on their <hi>Geneva</hi> Bibles printed at <hi>London,</hi> expones the ſackcloth to ſignifie poor and ſimple apparel. And <hi>Bale</hi> upon the ſame place writes, that this ſackcloth ſignifies ſober converſation.

                  <p>As for theſe diverſe expoſitions which ye mark in us, that have ſo ſtirred up your affections, that ye cry out, God knows whether this be wholſome doctrine to teach the poor people, or not. I anſwer; That theſe diverſe expoſitions of ours, are all agreeable to the analogie of faith, as your ſelf will not deny: and therefore cannot be called unwholſome doctrine. Otherwiſe, not only the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but alſo your own Doctors, and Biſhops, and Popes, have delivered unwholſome doctrine, by your reaſon; for they have exponed innumerable places of Scripture di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly: which is ſo manifeſt, that I need not prove it, and your ſelf alſo hath delivered unwholſome doctrine here: for ye expone <hi>bleſſing and thanksgiving, for two contrary things,</hi> and yet <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith, <hi>that ſome Catholicks take them both for one.</hi> And what ſhal I ſay of your diverſe expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were tolerable, ſo being they were according to the proportion of faith; your contradictions one to another, and that not only in exponing the Scripture, but
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:106559:180"/> in the main points of your Religion; ſome holding one thing, and ſome another, as partly hath, and partly ſhal be marked, are manifold? And if diverſe expoſitions of a place of Scripture be unwholſome doctrine, as ye ſay, then ſurely this point of your Catholick doctrine, which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that the <hi>Scripture hath a five-fold ſenſe, and that it may be five diverſe ways exponed,</hi> muſt be unwholſome doctrine, and then ye loſe more then you can win by this. Beware, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> that by this dealing ye bring not your ſelf in ſuſpicion that ye are forſaking your Catholick Faith: For this is a point of it, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> reports, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de interpret. verb. cap.</hi> 3. As for your calumnies: firſt, in calling us new Evangeliſts, I anſwered to that before: next, in ſaying that all our proofs and grounds are upon propheſies and dark ſayings. Firſt, you injure the holy Ghoſt in calling his propheſies dark: for the cauſe of this is not in them, but in our blindneſs. Secondly, ye ſpeak too plain an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth: for it is more then manifeſt, that not only prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, but alſo the plain and ſimple doctrine of the whole Scripture, is the grounds and proofs of our Religion, as is manifeſt by the points of doctrine which we have han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled here.</p>

                  <p>And it follows in <hi>M. John.</hi> And at the laſt, ſaith he, they ſhal be put to death, &amp;c. Here is two things to be noted. Firſt, that the Church ſhal not be inviſible in the time of Antichriſt: for if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church be inviſible, how ſhal they be taken, and put to death? If the Antichriſt and his members ſhal ſlay them, how can they do the ſame, except they know and may ſee them? To be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, is not to be known or ſeen: but they will ſee and know them, or elſe they cannot diſcern them from their own, whereby they may put them to death, and ſave their own. The ſecond thing to be noted, that our Miniſters in <hi>Scotland,</hi> except they be put to death by the Pope, they bear not the teſtimony of Chriſt.
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:106559:180"/> For theſe are <hi>M. Johns</hi> own words. And <hi>S. John</hi> ſaith, That the beaſt ſhal ſlay the two Witneſſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.7.8. Now by <hi>M. John,</hi> the beaſt is the Pope, and the Witneſſes is the Miniſters: therefore the Pope muſt ſlay the Miniſters: and after that, their bodies muſt ly three dayes and an half, not in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for there was the Lord of theſe two Witneſſes ſlain, <hi>Rev</hi> 11.19.11.12. And after, they muſt revive and aſcend up to heaven in a cloud in the ſight of their enemies, and ſo forth. Which things I truſt ſhal come to paſs to none of them in our dayes, nor long after the Laird of <hi>Merchiſtons</hi> doomſday, <hi>in his</hi> 14. <hi>Prop.</hi>

                  <p>As for the firſt thing which you infer here, concerning the inviſibility of the Church, becauſe you have the ſame argument afterward, I refer the anſwer of it to that place. As for the ſecond thing which ye infer, that except the Miniſters of <hi>Scotland</hi> be put to death by the Pope, they bear not the teſtimony of Chriſt. I anſwer: As it is true that it is propheſied of the Antichriſt, that he ſhal ſlay the two Witneſſes of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.7. and that he ſhal make war with the Saints, and overcome them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.12.13.15.17. ſo is it likewiſe propheſied, that his cruelty ſhal not always continue; but at the laſt, <hi>The Lord ſhal take his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in his own hand, and the Goſpel ſhal be preached to them that dwel upon the earth, and Babel that great city ſhal fall, Rev.</hi> 13.6.8.9. <hi>and</hi> 18.21. So that the blood which your Church hath ſpilt of the Saints of God already in all the parts of <hi>Europe</hi> theſe three hundred years by paſt, and that in ſuch abundance, that ſuppoſe the Lord may number them, yet no man is able to number them. And the patience and ſuffering of our brethren, is a ſufficient evidence that both your Popes are the Antichriſt, and they are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, ſuppoſe they ſlay no mo of them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Lord hath ſhortened your power, yet ye want no good will to ſpill the blood of the reſt. That ranſacking
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:106559:181"/> of <hi>Germany,</hi> that cruel perſecution of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and bloody Inquiſition of <hi>Spain</hi> in the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> and that moſt ſavage and cruel maſſacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Navy, which the Lord diſcomfited with his own mighty and outſtretched arm in the 1588. year of God, doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently teſtifie what heart ye bear to the Miniſters of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> if your power were according to your malice: <hi>But fulfill ye the meaſure of your fathers, that the blood of all the righteous may come upon you.</hi> As for the Propheſie of the ignominious handling of the bodies of theſe Witneſſes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their ſlaughter, it is alſo fulfilled by your Popes, and their authority, upon the carcaſſes of the Saints of God, which in all parts almoſt where ever their blood was ſhed, was moſt ignominiouſly handled, as though they had been not the bodies of men, but the dead carions of dogs and ſwine. Let both Hiſtories, and ſome who yet live, bear witneſs of this. As for the time and place, and their revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and aſcending up to heaven, it is to be underſtood af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of propheſies, myſtically and figuratively, as I have proved before. The time of three days and an half, ſignifying all the time of your tyrannous cruelty. The place of their ignominy, is the ſtreets of that great City, which is here called <hi>Sodom and Egypt, and the place where our Lord was crucified,</hi> not literally, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, as the text ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.9 18. And alſo called <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the 14. and 17. and 18. of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which is literally, <hi>that ſeven hilled City, which hath dominion over the Kings of the earth, Rev.</hi> 11.8 <hi>and</hi> 17 5. which as <hi>Bellarmin lib. de Rom Pont. cap.</hi> 2. confeſſes, <hi>is Rome properly.</hi> So as this great City is neither <hi>Sodom,</hi> nor <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor <hi>Babylon</hi> (ſuppoſe it be called ſo) literally, but only myſtically and ſpiritually as the Scripture ſaith, and your ſelf will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for the likeneſs between them: <hi>Sodom,</hi> for her filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and uncleanneſs: <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> for her tyranny
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:106559:181"/> and cruelty over the Saints of God, wherein ſhe reſembles them. So is ſhe not literally the place where Chriſt was crucified, but only myſtically and ſpiritually, for the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between them: that as by the authority of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Rome,</hi> his Deputy <hi>Pilat,</hi> our Lord was crucified, for the falſe challenge of treaſon againſt the Emperor, which was falſly and wickedly laid to his charge: and therefore is ſaid here by the holy Ghoſt, to be crucified at <hi>Rome;</hi> that is, by the authority of the Rulers at <hi>Rome:</hi> So by the authority of the Popes, who now reign, and have reigned theſe many years at <hi>Rome,</hi> Chriſt is crucified again in his members, becauſe they will not receive his mark, and worſhip him. And as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> boaſted her ſelf to be a holy City, and the ſpouſe of Chriſt, and yet was an harlot, a murderer, and a perſecuter of the Saints: ſo <hi>Rome</hi> doth boaſt her ſelf to be an holy City, and the ſpouſe of Chriſt, and the Head of all; and yet is now, and is long ſince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an harlot, and a murderer, and a perſecuter of the Saints. And if ye will ask, When did the bodies of the Saints ly in the ſtreets of <hi>Rome?</hi> I anſwer: As by the <hi>gates in the city,</hi> in the fourth command, <hi>Exod</hi> 20. is not meant the gates of the City properly, but the authority and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the City: ſo by the ſtreets of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not only meant the gates within the walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> but all the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and parts whither his power &amp; dominion hath ſpread its ſelf. So that all the places where the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have exerciſed their tyranny over the Saints are called here <hi>the ſtreets of that great City.</hi> All theſe therefore who have been cruelly murdered by the Popes authority, in <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi> the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> &amp;c. and whoſe bodies have been caſt out, and whoſe bodies have been ignominiouſly handled they have lyen in the ſtreets of that great City. And as all the reſt of this Propheſie is to be underſtood ſpiritually: ſo is this, <hi>reviving and aſcending
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:106559:182"/> of theſe Witneſſes to heaven in the ſight of their enemies,</hi> to be underſtood, not literally, but ſpiritually. So this is not the meaning of the holy Ghoſt, that theſe Witneſſes whom the Antichriſt ſhal ſlay, ſhal be raiſed up again in their own perſons (which yet ſhal be at the laſt day in the general reſurrection:) but that the Lord ſhal raiſe up other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, indued with that ſame Spirit which they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with, preaching the ſame truth, and maintaining the ſame cauſe againſt Antichriſt, as that Propheſie in the 3. of <hi>Malachie,</hi> of the <hi>ſending of Elias before the coming of Christ,</hi> was fulfilled as our Savior teſtifies, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.10.14. not in the raiſing up of <hi>Elias</hi> in his own perſon again; but in the ſending of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> in the vertue and ſpirit of <hi>Elias.</hi> So this Propheſie concerning the reviving of theſe two Witneſſes, whereby was figured the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt who was murdered in the time of Popery, as <hi>John Wicleff, John Hus, Jerome of Prague, M. George Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhart,</hi> and many others, is fulfilled; not by raiſing up of their perſons again, but of others his faithful ſervants, who in their vertue and ſpirit, have defended and maintained that ſame doctrine and cauſe againſt the Antichriſt, as <hi>Martin Luther, Calvin, Bucer, Peter Martyr, M. Knox,</hi> and ſundry others, whom the Lord hath, and dayly raiſes up in all Countreys, for the overthrow of your <hi>Babel.</hi> As for your truſt what will come to paſs, we paſs not; for ſo much hath been fulfilled of theſe propheſies, which teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies your Head to be the Antichriſt, and the Miniſters of the Reformed Church to be the faithful ſervants of Chriſt. And the reſt concerning your dayly <hi>conſumption and final abolition,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.2.21. <hi>and</hi> 19.20. we know aſſuredly ſhal come to paſs; becauſe the Lord hath ſo thought it, and ſaid it. And as for any further proof of the clemency and meekneſs of your Popes, if ſo the Lord will, we deſire it not. For as it is ſaid of the wicked man,

                     <hi>Your compaſſions are cruel,</hi> and your by paſt cruelty teſtifies of what ſpirit ye are. And ſuppoſe you ſay you truſt that this (among the reſt) ſhal not come to paſs, yet I fear you long to ſee that day upon the Miniſters of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which your brethren rejoyced to ſee fulfilled in that cruel perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and in that bloody maſſacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> of the Saints of God there: For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think but that ye are of the ſame ſpirit and mind which your brethren were of, otherwiſe ye are not a right Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick. As for the Laird of <hi>Merchiſtons</hi> conjecture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the day of Judgement, he hath his own probable reaſons: and if you be as good as your word, as your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorers have reported of you, we will ſee the refutation of his book by you. And ſuppoſe I know the time to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain to man, or Angel, as our Savior ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.36. yet his conjecture thereof is in greater modeſty and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, then your determination thereof. Whereby if the doctrine of your Church be true concerning the Antichriſt, whom ye imagine is yet to come, and the time of his reign, which ye ſay is to be but three years and an half: then not only the year, but the very day thereof may be known of them that live in thoſe days. For the Scripture ſaith, <hi>He ſhal be aboliſhed by the brightneſs of his coming,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.8.

                  <p>My meaning is this, That ſuppoſe in the darkneſs of Papiſtry he was taken to have been the Vicare of Chriſt, yet now the <hi>Lord hath ſmitten him, and conſumed him by the ſword of his mouth,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.8. that is, the Word of God: and hath diſcovered him to the full, to all theſe whoſe eyes the Lord hath opened, that he is that Antichriſt which the Scripture hath fore-told was to come.

                  <p>Whether oppugn ye your own imagination, <hi>M. Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> here, or that which I write? If the firſt, then you are fooliſh who fight againſt your ſelf, as ye do indeed. If the ſecond, then I ſay, that which I ſaid was this: That no man ſhould think that the Church of God was ever open and viſible in that flowriſhing eſtat, as it is now. For this is our doctrine concerning the inviſibility of the Church, the which becauſe you know not, therefore you ſtumble at it, and oppugns only your own invention, and not our doctrine: and therefore your reaſons and Scriptures which ye bring here, ſerve to no purpoſe, for they make nothing againſt us. We ſay, that the Catholick Church which comprehends all the elect, is always inviſible, both becauſe the principal part thereof is in heaven: and alſo becauſe the ſenſes of men cannot diſcern who are true members of the Catholick Church here, their effectual calling, their faith, love, hope, and inward graces: their union with Chriſt their Head, their ſpiritual armor, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons and warfare, and their Head Chriſt Jeſus, and their whole glorie is inward and inviſible, and they ſhal never be ſeen all gathered together until that great day, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25.26.27.32. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.13. <hi>John</hi> 10.27. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.28. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3.4. So that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they may be ſeen outwardlie, as they are men, and ſometimes in reſpect of their outward miniſterie: yet in ſo far as they are a part of the Catholick Church; that is, in ſo far as they are choſen, and ſanctified, &amp;c. as hath been ſaid, they cannot be diſcerned by the ſenſes of men, and ſo are inviſible. Next, we ſay that the particular viſible Churches are not always in one outward eſtat: ſometimes outwardlie glorious, ſometimes more obſcure: ſometimes openly known, and ſeen by all: ſometimes known and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:106559:185"/> ſeen but by a few: ſometimes frequent, and conſiſting in many, ſometimes rare, and conſiſting in few: ſometimes adorned with outward ornaments of peace, largeneſs, outward glory and multitude: ſometimes again wanting this outward glory under perſecution: but yet having that inward glory of theſe inward graces. So that when we ſay theſe particular Churches are ſometimes inviſible, we do not mean as though they were known to none (for that is not our doctrine, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> as ye imagine:) but that they are not ſo openly known that they are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to all to be the true Church, but known unto them with whom they have to do, and who profeſs the truth with them. Yea, ſometimes ſome of them are known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very perſecuters and enemies, by their conſtancy and perſeverance in their ſufferings, ſuppoſe they allow not their profeſſion. And in this ſtate was the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the time of <hi>Elias,</hi> when he complained that he knew none left but himſelf of the true worſhippers of God, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 19.10. And the Church of <hi>Juda</hi> in the days of <hi>Achaz</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.24. 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 16.10. And ſuch like in the time of Chriſt, both in the time of his living among them, as alſo in the time of his death and reſurrection, the Church was brought to a ſmal handful: The Princes, Prieſts, and Scribes, who only was in dignity and authority, being perſecuters of Chriſt, condemned him, and crucified him. And ſuch like in the time of the perſecution of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> the Emperor, and in the time of the <hi>Arrian</hi> hereſie, which over-ſpred, as it were, the whole world. The which alſo our Savior fore-told ſhould come to paſs: <hi>When the Son of man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhal come, ſhal he find faith in the world? Matth.</hi> 18.8. <hi>and</hi> 24 11.12. And by the Apoſtle alſo, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. And <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> in the time of the Antichriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9 1.2.3.4. <hi>and</hi> 12.6. <hi>and</hi> 13 14.15.16.17 <hi>and</hi> 14 8.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:106559:186"/> 
                     <hi>and</hi> 17.2. <hi>and</hi> 18.3. Confeſſed alſo by the learned of your own Church, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and the <hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> as they have been quoted before: and by your ſelf alſo, who confeſſed that the Church of Chriſt ſhould be redacted to a ſmal number, as it were in a wilderneſs, in the time of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. This now is our doctrine concerning the inviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Church, which is neither repugnant to the Word of God, nor yet to the examples which I brought in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward againſt your Religion. For both theſe <hi>(M. Gilbert)</hi> are true, and neither of them repugning one another: that the particular Churches in the time of the Antichriſt, are not ſo openly known, and ſo outwardly glorious and flowriſhing, as they were before; but redacted to a ſmal number, more obſcure and more latent: partly through that univerſal defection, and partly through that extream perſecution of your Church and Head; and that there was ſome that opponed themſelves to the Pope and his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and that even when he was come to the hight. If you will make theſe repugnant which are not <hi>adverſa,</hi> but only <hi>diverſa ſecundum magis &amp; minus;</hi> then I ſay ye are repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to all rules of reaſoning, and to the light of nature it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>Of this I may juſtly make an argument againſt <hi>M. John,</hi> that the Pope is not the Antichriſt. The woman that fled to the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is the true Church: and to flie to the wilderneſs, is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, as <hi>M. John</hi> ſaith.

But by <hi>M. John Welſch,</hi> there was many in that time that opponed themſelves to the Pope, and ſaid againſt him, and his Religion and Clergy, and therefore was known. Of the which the Popes did ſlay many, as he ſaith: Therefore it muſt follow, that either the Pope is not the Antichriſt, becauſe he did perſecute but viſible things, or elſe the Church was not inviſible all the time fore-ſaid.</p>

                  <head>Maſter John Welſch his Reply.</head>
                  <p>Let us ſee the force of this argument that ye make for your Pope, that he is not the Antichriſt. The woman, ye ſay, that fled to the wilderneſs, is the true Church. That I grant: and to flie into the wilderneſs, is to be inviſible by me. I anſwer: By me it is to be latent, and to lurk, to eſchew the rage of her perſecuters, and not to be openlie converſant, as that all the world may know her: and yet not to be ſo latent, but that ſome of them are known, both among themſelves, as alſo to their enemies. And this is our meaning (as I have ſaid before) when we affirm that the particular Churches ſometimes become inviſible. But you take it as though our meaning were, that the Church is ſo inviſible, that it is known to none; which is your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> and not our doctrine: and therefore you fight without an adverſarie in this point. But to go forward to the reſt of your argument: you ſay, that by me there was ſundrie that oppugned the Pope, and his Clergie, and was put to death by them. This is true: and therefore <hi>the blood of the Saints is found</hi> in your Church. Now what will you gather of all this? Therefore, ſay you, the Pope is not the Antichriſt, becauſe he perſecutes but viſible things, or elſe the Church is not inviſible. I deny that either the one or the other will follow. And becauſe you made an argument againſt your Pope (I ſhould have ſaid with him) that he is not the Antichriſt, which is grounded upon your own invention, miſtaking our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and therefore hath no feet. I will make another for him, that he is the Antichriſt, the which you, nor all your Clergy will not be able to diſprove. He is that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Antichriſt, which hath redacted the Church of Chriſt, as it were <hi>in a wilderneſs,</hi> to a ſmal handful: partly through the peſt of his damnable doctrine, partly through
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:106559:187"/> his extream perſecution, ſo that they were compelled to lurk and hide themſelves from the cruelty of his power. This you cannot deny, becauſe the Scripture affirms this of the Antichriſt. But I aſſume, that the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have done this theſe many hundred years, as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before, and in the other part of my anſwer: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of neceſſity it muſt follow that the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> are the Antichriſt that the Scripture fore told ſhould come. Anſwer this if you can.</p>
                  <p>And as for the time of this inviſibilitie, it hath relation to the beginning, and grouth, and hight of your Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Kingdom: For as it grew, the Church was more and more obſcured: and when it was at the hight, the Church was in her eclipſe: and as it hath decayed now ſince, ſhe hath accordingly ſpred her ſelf abroad. If the Apoſtle be true, that <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity began to work in his days,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.7. 1. <hi>John</hi> 4 3. For firſt, the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold hereſies which were ſown in the primitive Church, whereof the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have renewed a great many (as ſhal be proved hereafter) was the firſt ſtep to that Antichriſtian Kingdom. Next, <hi>the loving of preeminence in the Ministery over their brethren,</hi> as the Scripture teſtifies of <hi>Dictrephes,</hi> who loved preeminence, 3. of <hi>John</hi> 9. and ſpecially the aſpiring of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> to a Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Lordſhip over their brethren, forbidden by Chriſt; which was manifeſtly kythed in Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> who did take upon him to excommunicat the Biſhops of <hi>Aſia,</hi> for a light diſſention of the celebration of Eaſter, <hi>anno</hi> 198. And in others, as <hi>Cornelius, Zoſimus, Bonifacius,</hi> and <hi>Celestin,</hi> Popes, who did receive to their Communion thoſe who were excommunicat in <hi>Africa,</hi> was the ſecond ſtep. Thirdly, if it be true that theſe impious and ſuperſtitious Decreets which your Church aſcribes to the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> before <hi>Constantine,</hi> be theirs: as is not likely that
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:106559:187"/> ſuch ſuperſtitions did creep into the Church of Chriſt, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under perſecution: then, I ſay, the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> even before <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> by their ſuperſtitious Decreets, made a further entry to that Antichriſtian Kingdom. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was the <hi>let that hindered</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt to ſtep up to his throne, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.7. <gap reason="foreign">

The which they did not attain unto at the firſt, but piece and piece, and that not without long and great reſiſtance, both of the Church (as I have proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) condemning his Monarchy in all ages; and of the Emperors, as we ſhal ſee hereafter. And as they ever grew in their ſuperiority, ſo did the purity of the Church of Chriſt decay: and as a peſt infects not a Kingdom all at once, but piece and piece: ſo did your Antichriſtian hereſie: it infected not all at once, but piece and piece, till at the laſt it went over all. While as then <hi>Merchiſton</hi> makes the beginning of his reign to be in the 316 year of God, and the Church from thence to become inviſible: His meaning is, that <hi>then that let,</hi> which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, was begun to be removed, that his ſeat and throne might be in <hi>Rome;</hi> and from thence, as they grew in hight, ſo was the Church ay more and more continually obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, till at the laſt the Lord did ſcatter that darkneſs by the light of his Goſpel, which came to paſs in our days.</p>

                  <p>The Church that is ſet down to us in the Word of God, can no way be inviſible: for when the holy Writ ſpeaks of the Church of
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:106559:188"/> Chriſt, it ſpeaks of a viſible number of men and women, and no wiſe of Angels or ſpirits, as may be ſeen in theſe examples, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.4.3. <hi>Kings</hi> 8.14 <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18. <hi>and</hi> 18.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.3.4. <hi>and</hi> 18.22. <hi>and</hi> 22.28. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.</p>

                  <p>I come now to your arguments. Firſt, you ſay, that the Church that is ſet down to us in the Word of God can no ways be inviſible; becauſe, ſay ye, when it ſpeaks of the Church, it ſpeaks of a viſible number of men and women, and no ways of Angels or ſpirits. I anſwer, This is moſt falſe: For the Scripture ſets down to us that Church which is <hi>the body of Christ, Eph.</hi> 1.22.23. and whereof he <hi>is the head and Savior, Eph.</hi> 5.23. <hi>and which is built upon the rock, Col.</hi> 1.18. which is called, <hi>the congregation of the firſt born, whoſe names are written in heaven, Heb.</hi> 12.23. and that <hi>Jeruſalem which is the mother of us all, Gal.</hi> 4.26. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.28. And this is the Catholick Church which comprehends all the elect, as well triumphant as militant, which is inviſible, for the reſpects before ſaid, as I have proved. And ſuppoſe the elect that are here militant, may be ſeen, as they are men, and ofttimes alſo in reſpect of their outward profeſſion: yet it follows not but that they are inviſible, in ſo far as they are a part of the Catholick Church. And alſo that ſometimes through the extremity of perſecution, they may be latent and lurk, ſo that they are not openly viſible and known to all, as I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. As for theſe places of Scripture, to wit, <hi>Num.</hi> 20 4. 3. <hi>Kings</hi> 8.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.3.4. <hi>and</hi> 20.28. <hi>and</hi> 18.22. <hi>and</hi> 1. <hi>Tim</hi> 3 15 they ſpeak all of particular Churches, which we grant unto you are viſible, ſuppoſe not ay alike, as hath been proved. As for the 16. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> it ſpeaks of the Church of the choſen; for they only are built upon this rock, and againſt whom the gates of hell prevail not: and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:106559:188"/> they are inviſible, in reſpect before ſaid, as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved As for the 18 of <hi>Matthew,</hi> it is quoted afterward: therefore I refer the anſwer of it unto that place.</p>

                  <p>The Scripture alſo in many places compares the Church to viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things that cannot be unſeen: as, <hi>He hath placed his tabernacle in the Sun: A city cannot be hid ſet on a mountain.</hi> It is alſo compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a light ſet on a candleſtick to lighten the whole houſe, and not to be put under a bed, or a buſhel; with many the like, which I have omitted for brevities cauſe, ſaving ſome here at the end. Moreover, our Savior commands us to complain to the Church if our brother offend us: and alſo we ought to joyn our ſelves to the true Church, or elſe we cannot have remiſſion of our ſins. But how can a man complain to it, if it cannot be ſeen? Or joyn himſelf to it, if it be inviſible? The Church of Chriſt may never want the true preaching of the Word, and right adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but theſe things are always viſible, becauſe by the Miniſters they are the ſigns and marks of the Church: therefore the true Church may be always known by them. To be ſhort, not only the Word of God affirms the Church to be alwayes viſible, as I have noted before; but alſo the ancient Fathers in all their works, as partly I have marked alſo. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.6. <hi>read S.

                  <p>As for the 18. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> it ſpeaks not of the viſibility of the Church there, but of the Lords wonderful and glorious works; and ſpecially, in diſponing ſuch a glorious place or tabernacle, or throne, to the Sun to ſhine in, the which
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:106559:189"/> demonſtrates the glory of the Lord. As for <hi>Augustine</hi> expoſition, it reſults of the corrupted old Tranſlation, which was not taken from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> fountain, but from the verſion of the <hi>Septuagints:</hi> therefore <hi>Pagninus, Vata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> and <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> a Papiſt, and <hi>Tremellius,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone it not ſo, but after the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Secondly, he means not here of the Catholick Church, but of particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which were exceeding far enlarged in his days: but yet this hinders not but that they ſhould be obſcured in the time of the Antichriſt as it was fore-told, and your Church acknowledges. As for the 5. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> 15.16. there, not the Catholick Church, but the Paſtors of particular Churches, are compared to <hi>this light which is ſet up in the candleſtick, and to the city ſet up upon the hill top, which cannot be hid:</hi> that is, the eyes of all is on them; and therefore they ſhould be ſo much the more wake-rife and careful, becauſe their doings cannot be hid. As for <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.3. <hi>and</hi> 60.20. <hi>and</hi> 61.9. <hi>and Dan.</hi> 2.35. <hi>and Mich.</hi> 4.12. they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of the greatneſs and clearneſs of the Church of Chriſt in the time of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and of the propagation of the Goſpel throughout the world, and of the ſtability and perpetuity of Chriſts Kingdom. But yet it follows not but both the Catholick Church is inviſible, as I ſaid before, and that the viſible Churches may be obſcured and darkened, as it was fore-told, in the time of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. As for the 18. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> 17. <hi>Go tell the Church, &amp;c.</hi> The Church is here taken for the Paſtors and Governors of particular Churches, which we grant are viſible; but yet it follows not but that both they and the profeſſors may be obſcured and darkened, either through hereſie, or through extream perſecution, or through both together, as it was fore-told in the time of the Antichriſt, and hath been fulfilled by your Church. As for the true Church, unto whom we ſhould joyn our ſelves. I anſwer: We can have no
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:106559:189"/> ſalvation unleſs we joyn our ſelves firſt to the Catholick Church, that is, unto Jeſus and his members by a ſpiritual communion, without the which there is no ſalvation. Next, unto ſome particular viſible Church, by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward communion of the Word and Sacraments &amp;c, if we know it, and poſſibly can joyn our ſelves unto it: For if either we know it, or may not, as theſe ſeven thouſand that bowed not their knee to <hi>Baal:</hi> then I ſay, ſalvation is not perilled. As for your laſt reaſon, <hi>The true Church may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want the true preaching of the Word, and right adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments.</hi> I anſwer: Firſt, there is not the like neceſſity of the Sacraments, as there is of the Word. Next, ſuppoſe they have it and thereby are known among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſome of them alſo to their adverſaries; yet it follows not that they are ſo openly viſible, that they are patent and known to all. As for example: There is no queſtion but theſe ſeven thouſand <hi>that did not bow their knee to Baal,</hi> 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 19.18. and theſe hundred Prophets who was hid in the caves, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 18.13. and <hi>the Apostles when all were ſcattered through that perſecution,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.1. had the exerciſe of the Word among them. And it is not likely that the Apoſtles wanted ſome to teach, ſuppoſe they were not known to all, no not to their perſecuters, otherwiſe they would have been perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. And ſuch like, we doubt not, but in the time of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> perſecution in <hi>England,</hi> and in other parts, under that Antichriſtian tyranny, but the Lord had his own, both Paſtor and people, among whom the truth was preached, ſuppoſe neither we nor their adverſaries knew them all: For it is oft-times for the ſafety of the Church to lurk, and to be hid, that ſhe may eſcape the fury and rage of her enemies. As for <hi>Augustin, Cyprian, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Jerome,</hi> which ye quote here, they ſpeak either of the perpetuity and eternity of the Catholick
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:106559:190"/> Church, or elſe of the largeneſs and clearneſs of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches which were in thoſe days, which is neither againſt the inviſibility of the Catholick Church, nor yet againſt the obſcure eſtat and ſmal handful of the Church of Chriſt, whereunto ſhe ſhould be brought in the days of the Antichriſt, as was fore-told by the Scripture, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in your Papiſtical Kingdom. For we grant that in their dayes the Churches of Chriſt was frequent and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, but yet they did not ay remain in that eſtat. For the Churches of the Eaſt are almoſt overthrown by the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> and the Churches of the Weſt by the Antichriſt. So that partly by the one, and partly by the other, the Church of Chriſt hath been redacted to a ſmal handful, as hath been ſaid.</p>

And <hi>Edward</hi> the third, King of <hi>England,</hi> deſpiſed the Popes curſe, and appealed from him to God, about the year of God 1346. And alſo ſundry Emperors, as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the fifth, <hi>Leo</hi> his ſon, and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the ſixth in the Eaſt, and <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. and <hi>Henry</hi> the 5. and <hi>Frederick</hi> the 2. in the Weſt. Will you call theſe Kings and Princes of the whole world, obſcure men? So all ſorts of men, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> both rich and poor, Princes and ſubjects, and theſe alſo within your own bowels, being overcome with the ſtrength of the truth of God, have ſpoken againſt your Religion. Why you call them infamous, and hereticks juſtly condemned, I know not, except it be becauſe they taught and profeſſed the truth of God, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned your Antichriſtian idolatry and abominations. But all are not infamous and hereticks, whom ye call ſo: and ſurely if murderers, hereticks, adulterers, Sodomites open bargainers with the Devil, and the vile monſters of the earth, is to be called obſcure, infamous and hereticks, then
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:106559:192"/> your Popes are to be called ſo; who of all men that ever the earth hath born, have been the vileſt monſters and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, as I have proved in my other Treatiſe concerning the Maſs and the Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, next, that you contend not whether they have ſpoken againſt the Pope or not; for all hereticks have ever barked againſt him, &amp; that ſore againſt your heart, <hi>M. Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert;</hi> becauſe you cannot deny but ye have taught this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with us: and if it be ſo, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> that theſe men and Churches, and many thouſands more of all ſorts, have taught this doctrine with us many hundred years before <hi>Martin Luther:</hi> for the firſt two which I named was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 400. years before him: then why were you ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, both to write it, and alſo ſpeak it, to blind your poor Countrey-men, to their and your damnation, that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was begun by <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> and never profeſſed before him? So leave off, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> to beguile the ſimple and ignorant people with this ſottiſh and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous reaſon of yours, <hi>Martin Luther is the author of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> For now your are inforced to grant the contrary, that infinit numbers have taught the ſame doctrine before him. The truth is too ſtrong for you, M <hi>Gilbert,</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells you to grant the thing that ye would wiſh with all your heart the people never knew it. But comfort your ſelf, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> for the truth will be victorious at the laſt, and your darkneſs dayly more and more will be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Indeed the leaſt ſtroke that ye can give for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of your Pope, is to call them all hereticks who have ſpoken againſt him: For I grant the Pope and his Clergy is not ſuch fools, as being their own Judges, to condemn themſelves, and to juſtifie them, who not only have taught it, but alſo ſufficiently did prove it, and many thouſands ſealed with their blood that he was the Antichriſt, and his Church <hi>Babel.</hi> But with them, they have <hi>the Son of God,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:106559:193"/> and the Apoſtles, Paul and John</hi> hereticks: for they alſo did condemn his idolatry, and tyranny, and errors. But whereabout now will ye contend, <hi>M. Gilbert?</hi> Ye ſay, whether their doctrine be hereſie or not? I would you and your Church would ſtand upon this, and give over all your other contentions while this were firſt proved, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their doctrine, in ſo far as they agree with ours; and ours, in ſo far as it diſſents from yours, be hereſie or not? that is, be againſt the Scripture or not: the which if you would do, then I hope our contention would ſoon be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But for as faſt as you run to this now, you will flee from it as faſt again, when we deſire to have yours and our doctrine tryed by the Scriptures, which of them is hereſie: and conſequently, whether ye or we be hereticks? And therefore you ever refuſe to let your doctrine be tryed by the Scripture, but run to your pretended antiquity, and ſucceſſions, Councils, and lying miracles, and many other vain ſtarting-holes, like a wild Fox when he is hunted out of one hole, he flies to another, and dares never abide the fair fields. And mark their craft (Reader) when we affirm that our Religion hath Jeſus Chriſt to be the Author of it in the Scriptures, as we offer to prove the ſame, ye refuſe this tryal by the Scriptures, and ſay, <hi>That Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther invented our Religion, and we had none that profeſſed it, and taught it before him.</hi> When we again reply, That we had ſundry of all ſorts many hundred years before him, even when your Kingdom was at the hight, and produces their names: they not being able to deny it, they ſlip from that again, and ſay, <hi>They contend not whether there was ſuch that taught ſuch doctrine or not:</hi> but they contend whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was truth or hereſie: ſo they run from one ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hole to another. But I will ask you (M. <hi>Gilbert</hi>) if it be proved that this their doctrine was not hereſie, will you contend any more then? Shal the plea ceaſe then?
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:106559:193"/> Will you ever ſlander our Religion of novelty, in ſaying, <hi>Martin Luther was the firſt that began it, and we had none who profeſſed before him.</hi> But you will ſay, This you have not proved. It is true, I had not proved it then: but now I hope I have proved it ſufficiently, that your Popes are the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and your <hi>Rome, Babel;</hi> which was one of the principal heads of the doctrine which ye taught, and ſundry others alſo. Diſprove you it, if you can, M. <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</hi>

                  <p>But you ſay, they diſſent from us in ſome things, and is not of our Religion in all things. Whereunto I anſwer: That ſuppoſe this were true, yet it will not follow but that they are of our Religion, ſeeing they and we do agree in the main foundations thereof. For we have learned to call
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:106559:194"/> them brethren; which do hold <hi>the foundation,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, ſuppoſe they have <hi>built hay, ſtraw, or timber upon the ſame.</hi> Otherwiſe, if ye will be content to be meaſured with that ſame meaſure wherewith ye meaſure us, if you will have none to be accounted of your Religion, but theſe only that profeſs with you in all things, as your Church doth now: then not only (by your reaſon) ſhal ye want the Lord Jeſus, his Apoſtles, the primitive Church, as ye do indeed: and that not only in the firſt ſix hundred years, but long after, till the thouſand year, and long after that alſo, to be of your profeſſion: becauſe not only the weightieſt points of your doctrine have not their original in the Scripture, and are unwritten traditions, by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſome of your ſelves: but alſo ſundry points of your Religion have been brought in after theſe dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unknown in the former ages, as your ſelves will not deny, and I have proved in ſome heads, in the other part concerning the Maſs. Yea, you ſhal want all the Fathers, by this reaſon of yours. For there is not one of them but they have their own errors, which ye your ſelves will not defend: and the moſt part of them are with us againſt you, in many things, which you cannot deny: and that which is more, ye ſhal want almoſt all the general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, except three or four, and many of your own Popes, Doctors, Biſhops, Cardinals and Jeſuits: for not only have ſome of them had errors, and ſome of them been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, by your whole confeſſions; but alſo ſome of them have been with us in ſome points againſt you, as I have proved before, ſo that I need not repeat them now. As for example, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> affirms, <hi>That the books of the Macchabees are Apocrypha, Lib.</hi> 19. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. <hi>in morali.</hi> And ſo have ſundry others of your Clergy, as <hi>Sixtus Seneſis, in lib.

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:106559:194"/> Hugo Cardinalis,</hi> are againſt you, and with us, in the books of <hi>Apocrypha. Gelaſius de duabus naturis in Christo,</hi> is againſt your Tranſubſtantiation, alſo againſt your Communion under one kind: And Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the 6. againſt this, that the Pope cannot err, and teach he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies. <hi>Panormitan</hi> againſt this, that it is not lawful to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to marry after their ordination. <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Clericis, cap.</hi> 19. <hi>Idem lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de purg. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Michael Bai, Gerſon</hi> and <hi>Roffenſis,</hi> all Papiſts, againſt your venial ſins. <hi>Bellarm. lib. de imaginibus, cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Abulenſis,</hi> and <hi>Durandus,</hi> and <hi>Pereſius,</hi> Papiſts, againſt your making of the Images of the Trinity. A great many of you, as <hi>Alexander, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, Cajetan, Bonaventure, Marſilius, Almain, Carthuſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Capreolus,</hi> teach, <hi>That that ſame worſhip ſhould be given to the Image, which is given to that which the Image re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents:</hi> And yet <hi>Durandus</hi> and <hi>Alphonſus a Caſtro,</hi> and others, is againſt this: Therefore either the one or the other is not of your Religion. And ye your ſelf, if ye be meaſured by this meaſure, is not a right Papiſt, becauſe you diſſent from many of them in many things, as hath been proved before. And certainly <hi>(M. Gilbert)</hi> if this reaſon of yours hold forth, you ſhal cut off from your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſuch a number of Popes, Councils, Jeſuits, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and Doctors from your Religion, that it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they cut you off from being a right defender of their Catholick Faith, yea from being a member of their Synagogue, that for the defence thereof is compelled to cut off ſo many from the ſame. And ſecondly, I ſay, your reports concerning their doctrine, is not to be credited, but their own Apologies and Writings: whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that it hath been always your faſhion, the more to diſcredit them, to charge them with a number of abſurd opinions, which they never held. As for example, you charge here <hi>Waldus,</hi> and his followers, to have had their
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:106559:195"/> wives, and all other things common, which is your calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, and not their practiſe, or doctrine. For <hi>Guliel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Parvus</hi> writeth, <hi>that their life was commendable.</hi> And <hi>Reynerus</hi> in his Book of Inquiſitions, one of your own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, a Writer of 300. years ago, who was often at the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of them, as he himſelf ſaith, confeſſeth, <hi>That they had great ſhow of holy life, and that they believed all things well of God, and all the articles contained in the Creed, and lived juſtly before men: and chargeth them that they hated and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed</hi> ſolam Romanam Eccleſiam, <hi>the Romiſh Church only.</hi> So then, if his report be true, as I hope ye will not gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, they were both far from that error; for that were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to believe all things well of God, nor yet to have a ſhow of holy life, and to live juſtly before men: and alſo they were of our Religion in all things.</p>
                  <p>And where you ſay that we renew many old condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hereſies. I anſwer: That neither the doctrine which I affirmed they taught here, was hereſies, nor yet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hereticks. But you and your Church who have condemned them for the truth of God, and have renewed old condemned hereſies, as ſhal be proved afterward. And we have renewed no hereſie at all, but only the truth of God, which your Church hath obſcured and buried. Therefore your concluſion is falſe, that our Religion was never profeſſed in all points, as it is now in <hi>Scotland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in no Countrey; no not, ſay you, by any one man, For it was taught and profeſſed by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and alſo by all the primitive Churches in their dayes, in all points, throughout all the parts of the world where they preached the Goſpel, as it is now in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as we offer to prove by their writings, and I have proved the ſame in ſundry heads here. Next, the ſubſtance thereof was continued many hundred years in the Churches of Chriſt, while partly by the hereſies that ſprang up (for
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:106559:195"/> the popple was ſoon ſown among the good ſeed, and the Myſtery of Iniquity began to work in the Apoſtles dayes) and partly by the <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and partly by the darkneſs of Popery, it was corrupted piece and piece. And what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference can you find between the Religion that the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> profeſſed, and us, if ye will give credit to their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, and <hi>Reynerus</hi> teſtimonies of them? As for <hi>M. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Bruces</hi> teſtimony, which ye produce, it ſerves no wiſe to confirm your purpoſe: but ſeeing ye abuſe the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Scripture, it is no wonder ſuppoſe ye abuſe the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of men. For it is moſt true which he affirms, that the truth of God hath continued for that ſpace in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom without hereſie or ſchiſm, as we never read it did in any Nation in the earth, in ſuch purity without hereſie and ſchiſm for ſuch a long ſpace. And yet it follows not but it hath dwelt in ſundry Churches in ſuch purity before, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not ſo long together, which you omit in your conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Doth it follow by his teſtimonie, but that our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hath been preached and profeſſed in all true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in all points, ſuppoſe not ſo long in ſuch purity as it is in <hi>Scotland?</hi> Neither doth it follow, but that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial and main points of our Religion have been profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in all Chriſtian Churches longer then that ſpace, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe mixed either with ſome hereſies or ſchiſmes. So you muſt coin a new Logick <hi>(M Gilbert)</hi> before ye can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm your propoſition by his teſtimonie.</p>

                  <p>You not two things here which are both falſe: The one, that I can find none that ſaid againſt the Pope and his Religion before the year of Chriſt 1158. For our Savior and his Apoſtles, and ſundry learned Fathers in all ages, and Councils, both General and Provincial, and ſome of your own Doctors and Popes, have ſpoken againſt the Monarchie of your Pope, and your Doctrine and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as I have proved before. And <hi>Reynerus</hi> a man of your own Religion, teſtifies, that ſome ſaid, <hi>The Waldenſes who had the ſame Religion which we profeſs, was continued from Sylvesters dayes, who lived about the</hi> 320. <hi>year of God. And ſome ſaid, that it continued even from the Apoſtles days.</hi> Therefore the firſt is falſe The ſecond thing is, that I can find none before <hi>Luther</hi> immediatly, the ſpace of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years and more. I ſee you are not aſhamed to ſpeak any thing for the defence of your Kingdom, were it never ſo manifeſtly falſe: For if appears that either ye are not acquainted with the Hiſtories of that age, or elſe ye diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble it of purpoſe: for <hi>John Wicleff</hi> he left ſo many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him in <hi>England</hi> who profeſſed our Religion, that though your Prelats did moleſt them what they could, yet they and their favorers in ſhort time grew to ſuch ſtrength and multitude, that by the year 1422. (which was an hundred years immediatly before <hi>Luther) Henry Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſley</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> wrot to the Pope that they all could not be ſuppreſſed, they were ſo many, but by force of war. The profeſſors of our Religion began to gather ſo great force in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> after the burning of <hi>John Hus,</hi> and <hi>Jerome of Prague,</hi> at the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which was about the year 1417. (which was juſt an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years immediatly before <hi>Luther</hi>) that they were able not only to defend themſelves by force of armes
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:106559:196"/> againſt the tyrannie of your Popes, but alſo obtained ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny notable victories againſt the ſtrongeſt power that the Pope did raiſe againſt them. <hi>In England William Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> was burnt, <hi>anno</hi> 1422. and two years after that <hi>William White</hi> was burnt. And betwixt that time and 1430. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham of Colcheſter, John Wadden,</hi> and <hi>Richard Hovington</hi> were burnt. And after that, <hi>Richard Wiche,</hi> and <hi>John Gooſe,</hi> one <hi>Braban,</hi> and one <hi>Jerome,</hi> and others with him, were burnt. <hi>Hieronymus Savanarola,</hi> a Monk in <hi>Italie,</hi> with two others, named <hi>Dominick</hi> and <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> were condemned to death at <hi>Florence,</hi> in the year 1500. with ſundry others, whom for ſhortneſs I omit here. Now ſurely, I cannot but wonder, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> that ye ſhould have been ſo impudent as to have ſet it down in writ, that I could get none that profeſſed our Religion an hundred years immediatly before <hi>Martin Luther.</hi> But the Reader may gather what credit he may give to your notes: and yet with ſuch impudent lies ye blind the poor people. Upon the which I gather, that both theſe concluſions of yours, is falſe. For the Church of Chriſt in all ages, even from the Apoſtles days to this day, hath ever had her own teachers and profeſſors (unto whom <hi>Martin Luther</hi> hath ſucceeded in his Religion) ſuppoſe not in the like fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencie and puritie, and that by reaſon partly of the <hi>ſmoke of that bottemleſs pit,</hi> that is, of your doctrine, <hi>which darkned both the Sun and the air, Rev.</hi> 9.2. that is, both teachers and people: and partly by your extream perſecution, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ye <hi>made war with the Saints of God, and overcame them, Rev</hi> 13 7.

Gilbert.</hi> But your Popes are like <hi>Novatus,</hi> who not only have diſturbed all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Congregations in <hi>Europe</hi> almoſt, by ſetting up and thruſting down ſuch Paſtors as they would, but alſo all the Kingdoms in <hi>Europe.</hi> As for this doctrine of <hi>Aerius:</hi> I anſwer you, as ye did me: I contend not whether he taught this doctrine or not, for the Scriptures have taught the ſame. But our contention is; whether they be hereſie or not, which you have not proved, nor ever will be able to prove by the Scripture. It is true <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> following him, reckon him among hereticks: but <hi>Theodoretus</hi> in his Book <hi>de fabulis Judaeorum,</hi> and the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Hiſtory, reckon him not among hereticks: and he was not condemned for an heretick in any Council: that therefore which he taught according to the Scripture, we imbrace. But as for the errors of the <hi>Aërians,</hi> which are errors indeed, and which are aſcribed unto them, <hi>as the damning of marriage, urging of continency, requiring them whom they receive to their fellowſhip, to forſake their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per things.</hi> Theſe hereſies, I ſay, your Church hath rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, who damns marriage, and urges continency in your Clergy, and receives none to your religious Orders, but ſuch as refuſe their own proper things As to the third, the <hi>Aërian</hi> and <hi>Eunomian</hi> hereſies, they ſecluded holineſs of life from that faith of theirs, and taught ſuch a faith that might ſtand with whatſoever ſins, and with perſeverance in them. Will you ſtand to this, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> before the Lord, that we teach ſuch doctrine? Is not this our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that only living faith which works by love, and brings forth good fruits, doth juſtifie? But you are like to
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:106559:198"/> them that know no other juſtifying faith, but ſuch a faith, as both the reprobats and the Devils may have. So this is your third calumnie.</p>

                  <p>As for the ſixth of <hi>Vigilantius</hi> hereſies, if the denying of prayer to be made to Saints be an hereſie, then it is an old hereſie: for it is the Lords, who is <hi>the ancient of days,</hi> for this is his doctrine: <hi>Call upon me in the day of thy trouble, and I will deliver thee Pſal.</hi> 50.15 <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.8.

                  <p>Whether <hi>Valentinus</hi> taught ſo or not, I contend not: but the queſtion is of this doctrine of the real preſence, whether it be contrary to Gods Word, or not; the which I have proved ſufficiently before in the fourth point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: and ſo the denying of it, is no hereſie. But yet it appears not by this teſtimony of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> which ye cite here, that he taught ſuch doctrine.</p>
                  <p>As for the 8. hereſie, it is a calumny to aſcribe it to us: for <hi>Melancthon, Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> have no ſuch doctrine. You are not aſhamed, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> of impudent lying.</p>
                  <p>As for the 9. of <hi>Novatus</hi> hereſie, that is a calumny to aſcribe it to us. For <hi>Novatus</hi> denyed that there was any place of repentance to theſe, who after they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, fell from the faith by any infirmity, or violence of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> teſtifies of him, that he ſaid, <hi>No man who hath fallen after Baptiſm, can any more obtain mercy.</hi> But our doctrine is contrare to this: for we teach that there is place to repentance for any ſin, except the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, which is ever puniſhed with final impenitency.</p>
                  <p>As for the 10. of the <hi>Manichees</hi> hereſie, their doctrine was, as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith there, <hi>That Baptiſm ſerved nothing for ſalvation to any: and that none who followed their ſect, ſhould be baptized:</hi> and therefore they brought in a contempt of Baptiſm, which is contrary to our doctrine. For we teach, that Chriſtians and their children is to be baptized: and that the contempt of it is damnable, ſuppoſe not the want of it.</p>
                  <p>As for the 11. and 12 hereſies, we contemn not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings that are appointed by the Church for lawful cauſes: but we deny that they ſhould be tyed to certain and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed dayes, as your Church doth: and we think it no
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:106559:200"/> hereſie to faſt on the Lords day, more then other dayes: both to ſtir up our repentance, and to make us more meet to holy and ſpiritual exerciſes, becauſe it is not contrary to the Word of God. As for <hi>Leo</hi> his Epiſtle, it is wrong quoted, for it ſhould be <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 91. and their faſting on the Lords day, is not like ours: for they faſted on the Lords day, becauſe they believed not that Chriſt was a true man, as <hi>Leo</hi> in that ſame place teſtifies which you will not ſay your ſelf that we do; for we acknowledge him to be a true man.</p>
                  <p>As for the 13. hereſie of the <hi>Pepuſians</hi> and <hi>Collyridians,</hi> their doctrine was that women might be Biſhops and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and might uſe theſe publick functions, as theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which ye have quoted, teſtifie: which is not our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but rather yours, who permit women to baptize in caſe of neceſſity. That they denyed Orders to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, there is no ſuch thing to be found in theſe places which ye quote here.</p>
                  <p>As for the 14. hereſie of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> if they denyed that theſe who were accuſed of any ſcandalous offence, and guilty thereof, ſhould make their confeſſion of it to God, his Miniſters, and the Congregation, for to take away the offence of it, then they erred, and our doctrine and practiſe condemn this: but if they denyed the abſolut ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of your auricular confeſſion, then is it no error; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no ſuch thing commanded in the whole Scriptures of God. Now as for the teſtimony of <hi>Boëtius,</hi> I have not ſeen it. As for their ſecond hereſie concerning Baptiſm, they taught, as <hi>Augustin</hi> reports in that place. <hi>That Baptiſm was not needful to children, becauſe they were born without original ſin,</hi> as they taught: which is an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie indeed: but this is a calumny to aſcribe it to us; for we teach that children are born in original ſin, and ſo ſhould be baptized. And ſurely this hereſie rather agrees
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:106559:200"/> to you, who teach, that <hi>Mary</hi> was not born in original ſin, and therefore ſhe needed not to be baptized.</p>
                  <p>As for the laſt of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> denying the order of Monks. I anſwer: Firſt, your Papiſtical and idolatrous Monks, are far different from theſe which <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> defended, and theſe of the primitive Church. <hi>Bellarmin lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>de indulgentijs.</hi> For firſt, they were bound to no preſcript form of dyet, apparel, or any thing elſe, by ſolemn vowes of wilful poverty, and perpetual continency, as yours are. Next, the former Monks remained in the order of privat men and laicks, and had nothing to do with Eccleſiaſtical charges, which was afterward broken by Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the fourth, <hi>anno</hi> 606. But yours are not ſo: they have Eccleſiaſtical char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and are more then privat men. And laſt of all, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their kind of life was mixed with ſome ſuperſtition; for the <hi>envious man ſoon ſowed the popple among the good ſeed, and the myſtery of iniquity began ſoon to work:</hi> yet their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was not defiled with Idolatry, worſhipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, prayers to Saints, opinion of merit, the ſacrifice of the Maſs, and other abominations, wherewith your Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Monks are defiled. Next, I ſay, theſe Monks and religious Orders of yours, have not their foundation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the four corners of the Scripture of God.</p>

                  <p>Now here was all the cauſe (Chriſtian Reader) that made <hi>M.

And ſome hereſies he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth upon us, which we never taught nor maintained: and ſome are ſuch, which are not hereſies indeed, but agreeable to the Scriptures of God. So that if we err in theſe, ſuffer us to err with Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles Now to anſwer to your argument which ye bring: <hi>What ever was hereſie in old times, is hereſie yet, and the defenders thereof hereticks.</hi> I anſwer: If ye define hereſie to be an error obſtinatly maintained againſt the Scriptures of God, I grant your propoſition. But if ye define hereſies in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to be whatſoever any one Father or Doctor, or ſome more, have rebuked as an hereſie, then I deny it; for ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie of the Fathers have maintained errors themſelves againſt the Scripture, and have accuſed ſome doctrine to be hereſies, which have been agreeable to the truth of God, which you will not deny, I hope. For if you would, I could prove it both of the Fathers. Councils, and your own Popes. Now to your aſſumption: <hi>But theſe former heads</hi> (ſay ye) <hi>which ye have ſet down, with many the like, was hereſies in old times, and the defenders thereof hereticks, as teſtifie the ancient Fathers.</hi> I anſwer: That ſome of theſe are hereſies indeed, and we abhor and condemn them more then ye; and ſome of theſe as falſly laid to our charge; and ſome of theſe are not hereſies indeed, but agreeable to the Scripture. And therefore your conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion falls not upon us, who have renewed no old condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hereſies, and therefore is not hereticks. And where you ſay, <hi>many other like.</hi> I anſwer: It is true they are like,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:106559:201"/> for they are both calumnies, and horrible untruths, and lies, as theſe have been; whereof one day ye ſhal make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the great God that judgeth the quick and the dead. <hi>But the pit which you digged for others, you have fallen in it your ſelf.</hi> For certainly in this you do as thieves do, who the better to eſchew the crime of theft which is juſtly laid to their charge, and that they may the more eaſily eſcape in a fray, do cry out and ſhout out upon others, <hi>Common thieves, common thieves.</hi> Even ſo do you: for theſe crimes whereof ye are guilty your ſelves, you falſly charge us with.</p>

                  <p>It is not impoſſible to prove your Popes to be the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. It hath been proved already by the learned on our ſide; to the which, you, and all your Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> is not able to anſwer. It hath been taught and ſealed with the blood of infinit number of Chriſtians: And I have not taken ſo long a term, as you have ſet down here; and yet, I hope, I have proved it ſufficiently. Put all your might to diſprove it, if you can. And as to that threatning of yours, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> wherein ye ſay, that all thoſe who will not openly and privatly obey the Pope, &amp;c. muſt drink of the wine of the wrath of God. If it may be believed, then how doth this ſtand firſt with your Popes pardons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he gives men pardon or licence to profeſs, ſubſcribe, and ſwear to our Religion, as it is reported that ſome of your own Religion have confeſſed it? Next, how ſtands it with the diſſimulation of your Jeſuites, and ſeminary
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:106559:205"/> Prieſts, when they come to any place where our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is openly profeſſed? Thirdly, what comfort is this which ye have pronounced to your own poor Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who do not openly avow Papiſtrie, but have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and communicat with us? Is this an open profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or not? And if it be not, if ye be a true Prophet, then muſt they drink of the wine of the wrath of God, then muſt they be condemned in Hell, by your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe they profeſs him not openly. And laſt of all, if this threatning of yours be true, then beſide the many infinit thouſands who profeſs him to be the Antichriſt you condemn to Hell all the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches, who in number far exceed them who obey you; and all the Churches that have been ſix hundred years and more after Chriſt: For they obeyed not the Pope openly nor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly as Chriſts Vicare over them, as I have proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And alſo you condemn a number of your Anti-Popes to Hell, with their Cardinals, Biſhops and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches who followed them: For they gave out themſelves to be Popes, and did not obey the other. As alſo a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Fathers of your own Religion, who in two Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, the one of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> where there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a thouſand Fathers: the other of <hi>Baſel,</hi> did not obey the Pope, in defining General Councils to be above the Pope. So, if ye ſpeak truth, infinit millions of Chriſtians, in all ages, and innumerable Churches, and thouſands of your own Religion, are condemned to Hell. But this is falſe, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> and who will believe you? And to the end now my concluſion yet holds ſure, That ſeeing his Kingdom is that <hi>ſecond beaſt that hath two horns like the Lamb, and ſpeaks like the Dragon, Rev.</hi> 13.11. And himſelf is, <hi>that man of ſin, and ſon of perdition, that adverſary and Antichriſt that was to come,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.3.4. And his doctrine, <hi>is that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie and abomination ſore-told in the Scripture, Rev.</hi> 17.
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:106559:206"/> And his ſeat, <hi>that Harlot, and myſtical Babylon, that mother of whoredoms, who is drunken with the blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus. Whoſoever receives his mark on his fore-head or hand,</hi> that is, openly or privatly, profeſſes obedience unto him, ſhal (as the Angel proclaimed) <hi>drink of the wine of the wrath of God, yea of that pure wine in the cup of his wrath, and he ſhal be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy angels, and before the Lamb. And the ſmoak of his torment ſhal aſcend for evermore: and they ſhal have no reſt day nor night which worſhip the beaſt or his image.</hi> And as for your prayer, I beſeech God <hi>(M. Gilbert)</hi> that he may open my eyes, and inlarge my heart to underſtand and imbrace his truth more and more, and to make me to grow up in that ſpiritual communion with Chriſt and his members more and more. But that which ye call truth, is hereſie, and that which ye call the true Church, is <hi>Babel:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that doctrine and Church of yours, <hi>is that ſtrong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and whore of Babel;</hi> with the which, whoſoever ſhal communicat, is excluded from the merits of Chriſt, and ſhal be partaker of her plagues, and finally ſhal be damned.</p>

Thou wouldeſt know (Chriſtian Reader) of what weight this controverſie is, <hi>Whether the Pope be the Antichrist, or not?</hi> For this ſupremacy of his unto them, is the foundation whereupon their Religion, and the ſafety of their whole Church depends: ſo that they call it, <hi>The Rock whereupon the Church is built, againſt which the gates of Hell ſhal not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, Rhemiſt. annot. upon Matth.</hi> 16. And <hi>Bellarmin</hi> calls him, in his Preface before the controverſie of the Popes ſupremacy, <hi>The foundation which upholds the houſe of God: the Pastor which feeds his flock: the Emperor which governes his hoſt: the Sun which gives light to the ſtarrs; that is, to the Miniſters of the Church: the Head which gives life to his body. So that remove his ſupremacy, the houſe of God muſt fall, the flock of Chriſt muſt be ſcattered, the hoſt of the Lord muſt be diſcomfited; the ſtarrs, that is, the Miniſtery, muſt be darkened, and the body muſt ly ſtill without motion.</hi> And he applyes theſe Propheſies, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28.16. <hi>and</hi> 8.14.15. ſpoken and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled only in the Son of God, unto him a calling him <hi>that foundation ſtone in Sion, upon the which the whole Church is built:</hi> and that <hi>proved ſtone,</hi> againſt the which the gates of Hell hath never, nor never ſhal prevail: and <hi>that corner ſtone,</hi> which joyns both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentil,</hi> as two walls to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a Chriſtian Church: and <hi>that precious ſtone,</hi>
                     <pb n="348" facs="tcp:106559:207"/> from whence the infinit treaſure of grace is moſt plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly derived unto the whole Church: as unity in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the bond of peace, the unity of faith, which is ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation it ſelf, and the very life of Religion: And he ſaith, <hi>There is no way to Chriſt, but by Peter,</hi> in whoſe room their Popes ſucceed: So that in their judgement, there is no way to Chriſt, but by the Pope. And he calls him that <hi>rock of offence, and ſtumbling ſtone,</hi> ſpoken of in <hi>Iſai. chap.</hi> 8. <hi>Upon the which whoſoever ſhal fall, ſhal be broken: and on whom it ſhal fall, it ſhal daſh him in pieces.</hi> O blaſphemous mouth! Let the heavens be confounded at this. And therefore this is of ſuch a weight, that <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8 hath made it an article of our Faith, whoſe words are theſe: <hi>We declare, we affirm, we define and pronounce, that it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether needful to ſalvation to all creatures, to be under the Pope of Rome: Extra. de minoritate &amp; obedientia, cap. unam ſanctam.</hi> So that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith, when the Popes ſupremacy is called in controverſie, <hi>The ſum of all Chriſtianity is called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion:</hi> and when that is controverted, <hi>Then it is controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whether the Church ſhould ſtand any longer or not, or fall and diſſolve?</hi> Unto them therefore it is an article of Faith, which muſt be believed and practiſed under the pain of the loſs of ſalvation. And unto us he is that ſelf-ſame An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt which the Scripture hath fore-told, time hath made manifeſt, and the Church hath ſuffered. Unto them he is the Head of the body of Chriſt, the Paſtor of his flock, the Sun that gives light to the ſtarrs, the foundation of the houſe of God, and a mortal God among men. Unto us he is Gods enemy, the ſon of perdition, the ſecond beaſt, and falſe prophet, 2 <hi>Theſſ</hi> 2.13 <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11. the adverſary of true Religion, a peſt in the body, a tyrant in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and Antichriſt in the Church. So thou ſees (Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reader) of what weight this controverſie is.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſee then how he defends him from being the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:106559:207"/> Antichriſt, and then you ſhal hear our reaſons to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. You ask, wherefore I ſet not down ſome places of Scripture to prove the Pope to be the Antichriſt? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: Not becauſe I could not, but becauſe it was not my purpoſe at that time. But now I mind to do it, God willing, after that I have anſwered to your arguments. Your firſt reaſon is, The <hi>Jews</hi> ſhal receive the Antichriſt; but they never received the Pope: therefore the Pope is not the Antichriſt. I anſwer: Your propoſition I deny, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhal receive the Antichriſt. For firſt, I will ask you, Are you of that opinion with <hi>Bellarmin lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Rom. Pont. cap.</hi> 12 the <hi>Rhemiſts annot. upon</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. and the reſt of your Clergy, that they ſhal receive him as their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which they look for? If you be not of their mind, then beſide that you diſſent from the doctrine of your own Church, it is not probable that the <hi>Jews</hi> would receive him, if they thought not he were their <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And if ye be of their mind, then I ſay, the <hi>Jews</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive none as their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but theſe who are born of the Tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> and the family of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and who ſhal reign in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But the Tribes are confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſo that they cannot know it, and the family of <hi>David</hi> deſtroyed by ſundry Emperors: or at the leaſt ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded that they cannot be diſtinguiſhed: and <hi>Bethlehem</hi> is deſtroyed, and the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> utterly caſten down: therefore the <hi>Meſſias</hi> which they look for, will never come. And ſo (if this be true) the Antichriſt which ye imagine here, will never come, ſince your Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and their <hi>Meſſias</hi> that they look for, are both one, as your Church ſuppones. And I ſay further, <hi>Sanderus in</hi> 8. <hi>demonſt,</hi> and the <hi>Rhemiſt. annot. upon the</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. ſay, the Antichriſt ſhal come of the Tribe of <hi>Dan:</hi> if then he ſhal come of the Tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> (as they ſay) the <hi>Jews</hi> will never receive him as their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> becauſe they know
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:106559:208"/> their <hi>Meſſias</hi> which they look for, ſhal come of the Tribe of <hi>Juda.</hi> Therefore if <hi>Sanderus</hi> and the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> ſpeak true, the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhal never receive the Antichriſt at all. Thirdly, I lay this ground which you cannot deny, that the <hi>Jews are to be planted in again in the natural olive;</hi> that is, they are to be converted to Chriſt, becauſe <hi>their fall was but for a time,</hi> as the Apoſtle plainly fore-tells, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.24. and the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> grant it, <hi>annot. upon that chapter.</hi> Upon the which, I ask you <hi>(M. Gilbert)</hi> whether ſhal they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Antichriſt, before or after their converſion? If you ſay, after: then I ſay, after they have embraced the true Meſſias and the Goſpel, how can it be that they will look for another Meſſias, and receive the Antichriſt as their Savior. Next, we read of their converſion in the Scripture, but nothing of their rejection of Chriſt after their converſion. And thirdly, ſeeing (as your Church ſaith) the Antichriſt ſhal be ſent to them, and they ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, becauſe they received not Chriſt Jeſus: of force then it cannot be after their converſion. For the cauſe, to wit, their hardneſs of heart, and refuſal of the true Meſſias being taken away, this puniſhment ſhould not be ſent unto them after their embracing of Chriſt: ſo not after their converſion. And if you ſay, before their converſion; then I ſay, either muſt you make the reign of your Antichriſt longer then three years and an half (which your Church doth) and put a greater ſpace betwixt the perdition of him, and the end of the world, then your Church doth. (For <hi>Bellarmin</hi> puts but 45. dayes between his perdition and the end of the world, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Rom. Pont. cap.</hi> 17.) and ſo overthrow your own doctrine concerning the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, that ye may eſtabliſh your imaginary Antichriſt. Or elſe what likelyhood is there that ever they ſhal be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Chriſt, which is againſt both the Scripture, and your own doctrine? For ſeeing the <hi>Jews</hi> are to receive
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:106559:208"/> him as their Meſſias, and ſeeing he is to build their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, reſtore their ceremonies, and obtain the Monarchy of the whole world, eſpecially by their help (as your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine affirms, <hi>Bellar. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Rom. Pont. cap.</hi> 12. 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) ſhal not this drive them further from Chriſt, and harden their hearts more then ever it was before? And ſeeing he ſhal reign but three years and an half, and they cannot embrace the true Savior, as long as he reigns (for they cannot embrace both the Antichriſt, and the true Chriſt together) and ſeeing after his death the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhal come immediatly, or at the leaſt 45. days after (as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith:) how can it be poſſible that they ſhal ever be turned to Chriſt before the end of the world, if this your doctrine be true? Therefore they cannot receive the Antichriſt before their converſion, and ſo they ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receive the Antichriſt. So then to conclud this point, as the Meſſias which the poor blinded <hi>Jews</hi> look for, will never come, the true Meſſias being come already, whom they crucified; ſo the Antichriſt which ye imagine, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come; for the true Antichriſt (which either ye will not ſee, or elſe if ye ſee, ye will not confeſs him) lurks within your own boſom, theſe many years, whom ye labor to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that he ſhould not be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>But how prove ye that the <hi>Jews</hi> will receive the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt? Becauſe our Savior ſaith to the <hi>Jews, If another ſhal come in his own name, him ye will receive.</hi> I grant indeed our Savior ſo ſpeaks. But firſt, I ſay, this <hi>other</hi> is not to be reſtricted to the Antichriſt only, but to be referred to all falſe Prophets, who ſhal come, not being ſent of God: ſo <hi>Nonnus,</hi> ſo <hi>Lyra</hi> expone it: and this was fulfilled long ſince in receiving of <hi>Theudas</hi> and <hi>Cozban,</hi> and other deceivers whom they received, <hi>Joſeph. de bello Judaico, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>Pet. Gala. lib.</hi> 40. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. As for <hi>Augustin,</hi> it is true, he expones it of the Antichriſt. But if <hi>Bellarmin lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Rom.
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:106559:209"/> Pont. cap.</hi> 12. rejects <hi>Auguſtins</hi> opinion concerning the generation of the Antichriſt, that he ſhal come of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> becauſe <hi>it cannot</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be proved by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> ſhal it not alſo be lawful for us, not to be bound to the expoſition of <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> unleſs it be certain by the Scripture: ſo give us that liberty which ye take to your ſelves. Your firſt reaſon then hath no feet: for this place ſpeaks of all falſe Prophets whatſoever which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould receive; and it hath been accompliſhed ſundry times among them: therefore this yet remains unproved, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhal receive the Antichriſt. This for the firſt part of the argument. The ſecond part of your argument is, <hi>The Pope came never in his own name, but in the name of Chriſt; therefore he is not the Antichrist.</hi> Your antecedent I deny. For if ye will credit <hi>Franciſcus Toledo,</hi> if ye know him, writing upon the ſame place he ſaith, <hi>He ſhal come in his own name, who truly ſhal have no divine vertue, but ſhal fain himſelf to be ſent of God, as the falſe Prophets came in their own name, becauſe they were not truly ſent of God. And this is that</hi> (ſaih he) <hi>which is ſaid now</hi> (meaning in this place) <hi>if any ſhal come in his own name, that he is not truly ſent of God, neither hath Gods power.</hi> So then a falſe Prophet is ſaid both to come in the Name of God, and in his own name: In the Name of God, falſly vaunting ſo: in his own name, becauſe God ſends him not; but he intrudes himſelf without a lawfull calling. Now to anſwer you then, I ſay, the Pope comes in the Name of Chriſt, as his Vicare: I grant, he and his Clergy ſo vaunt; but falſly. For the truth is, he hath come, and he comes in his own name, and that truly, becauſe the Lord never ſent him, but he hath intruded himſelf without God his calling: therefore this cannot free him, but he may be the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. But how prove ye that he comes in Chriſt his Name, and not in his own name? Becauſe (ſay ye) he calls
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:106559:209"/> himſelf the Vicar of Chriſt, and the ſervant of the ſervants of God. A pretty argument: He ſo calls himſelf: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is ſo. Who will credit either you or him in your own cauſe? Is this all ye can do for your Pope? He is called ſo: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is ſo. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non attendamus ad lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guam, ſed ad facta, Tract</hi> 3 <hi>in Epiſt. Joan.</hi> Let us not take heed to the tongue, but to the deeds. For if all be asked, &amp; all with one mouth confeſs Chriſt, let the tongue ceaſe a little, &amp; ask the life: <hi>Interroga vitam:</hi> and again, whoſoever denyes Chriſt <hi>(factis)</hi> by his deeds, is Antichriſt. The ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters of <hi>Epheſus</hi> might have reaſoned ſo for their great Goddeſs <hi>Diana, Acts</hi> 19.27. She is called a great Goddeſs: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſhe is ſo indeed. And what falſe Prophet yet ever came, but they ſaid they came in the Name of God, &amp; they called themſelves and were called by theſe whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; Prophets of the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.25. <hi>Ezec.</hi> 13.6.7. and yet will you frame this argument for them, as you do for your Pope? All the falſe Prophets ſaid, they came in the Name of God, &amp; were called by theſe whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the ſervants of God; therefore they came not in their own name, but in the Name of God. Did not the falſe Apoſtles in <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſay, they were the <hi>Apostles of Chriſt, &amp; yet they were found liars? Rev.</hi> 2.2. And did not the <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan call themſelves Jews, and yet they blaſphemed in ſo ſpeaking? Rev.</hi> 2.9. Doth not the Harlot with whom the Nations of the earth have committed fornication, ſay <hi>in her heart, ſhe is a Queen, Rev.</hi> 18.7. and yet <hi>ſhe is that great Harlot? Rev.</hi> 17 4. And is not her <hi>cup of gold,</hi> and yet the drink therein <hi>is abomination?</hi> And ſhould not the Antichriſt ſit in <hi>the temple of God, and yet he is the ſon of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and an adverſary to God, and to Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4. And ſaid not the Devil of himſelf, <hi>that all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the world were given to him, and he would give them to whom he would? Matth.</hi> 4.8, 9 and yet he was a liar? So
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:106559:210"/> if this argument of yours will follow, The Pope is called the Vicar of Chriſt, and the ſervant of the ſervants of God, therefore he came never in his own name, and ſo he is not the Antichriſt: you may with as good reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clud, that the falſe Prophets, and falſe Apoſtles, came not in their own name, but in the Name of God, becauſe they are called the ſervants of God, both by themſelves, and alſo by theſe who were deceived by them. Yea, you may with as good reaſon conclud, that the Antichriſt is not the ſon of perdition, and adverſary to God, 2. <hi>Theſſ</hi> 2.3.4. &amp; that all the Kingdoms of the world are given to the Devil, and that he hath the power in his hand of giving them to whom he will; becauſe the Scripture fore-told of the one, that he ſhould have horns like the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. and the other aſcribes this right and power to himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.9. It is good therefore that you cannot defend your Pope from being the Antichriſt, unleſs with him alſo you defend all the falſe Prophets, falſe Apoſtles, falſe Churches, the Antichriſt, and the Devil himſelf, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing which they are indeed. But who will venter the ſalvation of their ſoul, upon this ſo ſilly and fooliſh a reaſon? But, I pray you, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> let me ask you this; Is your Pope the ſervant of the ſervants of God, and the Vicar of Chriſt, as he calls himſelf? Dare you avow this in the preſence of him who ſhal judge the quick and the dead, that he is ſo as he calls himſelf? Did ever Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus either tread upon the necks of Kings and Emperors with his feet? Or was he ever lifted up and carried upon the ſhoulders of noble-men? Or did he ever give his feet to Emperors to kiſs, as your Popes have done, as your own Hiſtories do witneſs? And have ye ever read what one of his own Archbiſhops of <hi>Colen,</hi> one of his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, writes to Pope <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the firſt, five hundred years ago? Speaking to him, he ſaith, <hi>Thou pretends the perſon of
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:106559:210"/> the Pope, but thou playes the tyrant: we feel under the habit of a Paſtor, a wolf; the ſtile belyes the parent. Thou vaunts thy ſelf to be God by thy deeds: while as thou art the ſervant of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, thou contends to be Lord of Lords: according to the diſcipline of Chriſt our Savior, thou art the leaſt of all miniſters of the Temple of God; but thou by the ambition of ruling goes to ruine: whatſoever likes thee, is lawful, Aventinus lib.</hi> 4. <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalium.</hi> This was evil in thoſe dayes, but there are worſe ſince. And what now, Reader, ſhal we ſay of the Pope, ſince his own Archbiſhop hath ſo written of him? You ſay he is the Vicar of Chriſt, but Chriſt Jeſus in his latter Teſtament, did never leave him to be in his ſtead. For in the 4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 11. <hi>He gave Apostles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors and Doctors, for the work of the miniſtery, and the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the body of Chriſt.</hi> But that he ever left a Pope to be head of the Church in his ſtead, to be a Monarch in this earth, to reign in <hi>Rome,</hi> and to be Lord over the ſervants of God, there is not a ſyllable in the whole Book of God to prove it. And becauſe you ſay, he is the ſervant of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: what ſervice, I pray you, doth he whereby he makes it manifeſt that he is a ſervant indeed? For the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſervice of the Miniſtery of the Church, ſtands in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Word, which he neither doth, neither thinks that it appertains to him to do. Yea, what is it that appertains to any Lord, King, or Monarch in the earth, that he aſcribes not to himſelf, and doth not alſo practiſe? Yea, as though that were too little, what either ſtile or proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or works, which are peculiar only to God his majeſty, that he aſcribes not to himſelf: as, God willing, ſhal be proved afterward in the third mark of the Antichriſt. So that <hi>Aventinus</hi> ſaith of the Pope, <hi>He who is the ſervant of ſervants, is the Lord of Lords, and he deſires to beas though he were God. He ſpeaks great things, as if he were God. He chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the laws, eſtabliſheth his own. He reaves, he ſpoils, he
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:106559:211"/> deceives, he ſlayes: that man of perdition, whom men uſe to call Antichriſt</hi> (ſpeaking of the Pope) <hi>in whoſe fore-head the name of blaſphemy is written: I am God, I cannot err.</hi> So what is this elſe, but a horrible mocking both of God and man, to ſtile him the ſervant of ſervants, ſeeing he hath lifted up himſelf ſo far above both God and man? So then to conclud this, as <hi>Goliah</hi> his own ſword ſlew himſelf, ſo the reaſon which ye bring to defend your Pope from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Antichriſt, doth moſt evidently convict him to be the Antichriſt. He may juſtly be called the Antichriſt, who under pretence of the Vicar of Chriſt, and the ſervant of ſervants, is Monarch and Lord over all: this you cannot deny. Becauſe the Scripture deſcribes the Antichriſt to have two horns like the Lamb, to ſit in the Temple of God, to have a golden cup, and yet to ſpeak like the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon; to be adverſary to God, and to lift himſelf above all that is called God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. <hi>and</hi> 17. 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. But ſo have the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> done, as it hath, and ſhal be proved by their own doctrine and practiſe, and which you cannot deny: Therefore he is in very deed, that Antichriſt which was to come. And this for your firſt reaſon.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>S. Paul</hi> in deſcribing of the Antichriſt, tells that he ſhal be but one, the ſon of perdition, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.3.

                  <head>Maſter John Welſch his Reply.</head>
                  <p>Your ſecond reaſon is, the Antichriſt is but one ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon. The Popes have been many: therefore they are not the Antichriſt. I deny your propoſition; for there lyes all the controverſie. We ſay, the Antichriſt is not this Pope, or that Pope, a certain perſon: but we aſcribe this name to the whole ſeat and the ſucceſſion of your Popes: We ſay, the body &amp; the Kingdom of your <hi>Roman</hi> Church, whereof your Popes are the heads, is that Antichriſt which was to come. So if you prove that the Antichriſt ſhould be but a particular perſon, and not a body, a Kingdom, a ſeat and ſucceſſion of men that are adverſaries to God and to Jeſus Chriſt, I will grant you have ſufficiently cleared your Pope from being Antichriſt. But content your ſelf, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> this ye will never prove by the Scripture: and therefore ye muſt let your Popes be accounted the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſtill. And if this reaſon of yours be good, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is one certain perſon: therefore the Popes, becauſe they are many, are not the Antichriſt: wherefore, I pray you, ſhal not this alſo be good; The Vicar of Chriſt is one certain man, but the Popes are many: therefore they are not Chriſt his Vicar? What difference, I pray you, is there between the one and the other? And if ye will ſay, the Vicar of Chriſt is not one ſingular man, but a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of many in one office: why will ye not alſo grant, that the Antichriſt is not a ſingular man, but the ſucceſſion of many in the ſelf-ſame impiety? So either chooſe you, whether will ye grant that the Antichriſt is not one ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man, but a ſucceſſion of many; or elſe that the Popes are not Chriſt his Vicar: For the one ye muſt do, if this reaſon of yours hold forth But how do ye prove that the Antichriſt is but one ſingular perſon? You ſay, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> tells that he ſhal be but one. How would ye have cryed
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:106559:212"/> out, if I had fathered ſuch a falſhood upon the Spirit of God, as you do here? But let ſuch be far from me. You ſay, <hi>S. Paul</hi> calls him <hi>the ſon of perdition,</hi> and puts him in the ſingular number: therefore ye ſay, the Antichriſt ſhal be but one ſingular perſon. I fear ye take pleaſure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſimple with ſuch ſilly reaſons. Our Savior ſaith, <hi>That a good man,</hi>

If then in theſe places there is not a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man underſtood, ſuppoſe they ſpeak of a man in the ſingular number; it will not follow that the Antichriſt muſt be one ſingular perſon, becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks of him as of one man, in the ſingular number; for the phraſes are all one: But the firſt ye muſt grant, therefore the next will follow. Secondly, in the 16. of <hi>Matthew</hi> 18. our Savior ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:106559:212"/> prove that he is not the Antichriſt. This rock upon the which Chriſt promiſed to build his Church, is but one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular perſon, becauſe our Savior puts him in the ſingular number (<gap reason="foreign">

What diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is there between your argument for the Pope, and this argument againſt the Pope, ſeeing both are grounded upon the like phraſe? Chooſe you then <hi>(M.

Or will you have the Popes not to be the rock whereupon the Church is built? For the one ye muſt. Thirdly, I ſay the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, ſpeaking of the Antichriſt, <hi>That the mystery of iniquity is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun even now to work,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.7. And <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>This is the ſpirit of that Antichriſt which ye heard was to come, and is even now preſent in the world,</hi> 1. <hi>John</hi> 4.3. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>The Lord ſhal deſtroy him with his preſence.</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.8. And your doctrine is, that he ſhal not come while the end of the world. Now what a monſtrous man will you make him, whoſe ſpirit was in the dayes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and who muſt continue till the end of the world, if the Scripture be true, a man of fifteen hundred years of age already? Is this credible? Or are you able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men that have but the leaſt drop of reaſon left in them, and believe the Scripture, that the Antichriſt ſhould be but one ſingular man, ſince the Scripture ſaith, that his ſpirit was preſent in the world, and his iniquity even then began to work in the Apoſtles dayes, that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 1500. years ſince, and he ſhal continue to the end of the world? Fourthly, is it poſſible that one ſingular perſon can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all theſe things, which either the Scripture or your own doctrine tell he ſhal do? For the Scripture ſaith, <hi>He
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:106559:213"/> ſhal reſemble the Lamb with horns: He ſhal ſpeak like the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon: He ſhal do all the power of the former Beast. He ſhal make all men to worſhip the beasts image: He ſhal make all, both rich and ſmal, &amp;c. to receive his mark, &amp;c. ſo that no man ſhal buy or ſell, but he that hath his mark, &amp;c. ſo that all Nations ſhal be drunken with the wine of her fornication, Rev.</hi> 13 <hi>and</hi> 14. <hi>and</hi> 17. <hi>and</hi> 18. And your doctrine is, that he ſhal build the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> have now in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: that he ſhal deſtroy <hi>Rome:</hi> that he ſhal aboliſh all Religion, and all the outward ceremonies thereof: that he ſhal conquer and overcome the ſtrongeſt Empires in the earth, and be Monarch of the whole world, <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Rom. Pont. and Rhemiſts annot. upon</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derus in his demonſtrations.</hi> Now, is it likely, or can it be, that any one mortal man is able to perform ſo great and ſo wonderful things? Was there ever yet any King, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or any other creature under heaven, that ever perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſo great and wonderful things, and ſpecially in ſo ſhort a time, as ye aſſign to your imaginary Antichriſt, as of three years and an half? That one city of <hi>Troy</hi> kept all the <hi>Grecians</hi> for the ſpace of ten years almoſt beſieging it, before they could overcome it. The Temple of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> was ſeven years in building by <hi>Solomon,</hi> who had ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and wealth above all the Kings in the earth who had an hundred fifty three thouſand and ſix hundred work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for the ſame, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. That great Conqueror <hi>Alexander,</hi> with whom no Monarch is comparable, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in power, nor happy ſucceſs was not able to conquer all <hi>Aſia</hi> the ſpace of ten years, which was the fourth part of the world. And ſhal we think that a miſerable <hi>Jew</hi> by the help of their ſcattered people, being an enemy to God, and all good men, ſhal be able to overcome that great Monarchy of the <hi>Turks,</hi> againſt whom all the power of Chriſtendom hath not prevailed: &amp; not only to overcome
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:106559:213"/> them, but alſo to overcome all the Empires and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in the earth, and to reſtore the city of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and build the Temple again from the foundation, and aboliſh all Religion, both true and falſe, except his own: (For this is the doctrine of your Church concerning the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt) and that in ſo ſhort a time as three years and an half, as you aſcribe unto him? Who will believe you, <hi>M. Gilbert?</hi> Will any <hi>Turk,</hi> Chriſtian, or <hi>Jew</hi> himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that any one man, ſuppoſe his age were never ſo long, and his perſon never ſo ſtrong, can be able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh and perform ſo many, and ſo wonderful things, as your own doctrine affirms ſhal be done by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt? So this doctrine of yours, that the Antichriſt ſhal be but one ſingular perſon, can neither ſtand with the Scripture, nor yet with your own doctrine concerning the Antichriſt. Fifthly, as partly hath been proved, this is the common phraſe of the Scripture, in the perſon of one to underſtand a multitude. And therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> in the deſcribing of the Monarchies, he compares them to ſundry beaſts in the ſingular number, to <hi>a Lyon, a Bear, a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard, &amp;c.</hi> and yet by them was not ſignified one certain perſon, but a ſucceſſion of Kings in the ſelf-ſame King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: and therefore the Antichriſt is likened to a <hi>beaſt,</hi> to ſignifie a Kingdom and ſucceſſion of perſons in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls the Antichriſt, <hi>A City which proſtituts its ſelf to fornication,</hi> to wit, ſpiritual, <hi>de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectione carnis. Ambroſe in Apoc.</hi> 17 calls <hi>the woman clad with purple</hi> (who is Antichriſt) <hi>the city of the Devil. Auguſtin</hi> calls that <hi>beaſt which is the Antichriſt, the ungodly and body of the wicked, who fights againſt the Lamb: a people contrary the people of God, which joyntly with their head, is called the Antichriſt: an heretical Church, which is called Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon. Nonnulli non ipſum Principem, ſed univerſum quodam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo corpus ejus, id eſt, ad eum pertinentem hominùm

So, I hope, the Reader hath ſeen nothing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Scripture, or by reaſon alledged by <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> wherefore the Pope may not be the Antichriſt.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>S.

If he deny this, I cannot tell what any man can ſay to him, but whether God will or not, he will have the Pope to be the Antichriſt, albeit it be repugnant to the Word of God.

                  <p>I come to your third raiſon. The Antichriſt ſhal be an adverſary, and is extolled above all that is called God. I grant that. But the Pope is not an adverſary, &amp;c. This I deny: the which if you prove, then ſhal I grant he is not the Antichriſt. Let us ſee your proofs then, for they had need to be ſure, ſeeing all your Religion and ſafety of your
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:106559:214"/> Church depend upon it: and if ye cannot clear him from being an adverſary to God, and from lifting up himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped, then your Head and your Religion is gone. You ſay, he is not an adverſary to God, becauſe he calls himſelf the ſervant of God, and prays moſt humbly to Chriſt. We anſwered to this before. It is not his ſtiles which he ſacrilegiouſly claims to himſelf, nor yet his form of godlineſs, that can free him from this: <hi>for wolves will be clad in ſheep skins, Matth.</hi> 7.15. And falſe Apoſtles and Prophets have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the authority and calling of God: And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle teſtifies, That <hi>there are many which profeſs God in word, Tit.</hi> 1.16. and <hi>Satan can transform himſelf in an angel of light,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. And it was fore-told, that the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhould ſit in the temple of God,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4. that is, in an eminent and high room in the Church of God, and that he <hi>ſhould have two horns like the Lamb, Rev.</hi> 13.11. that is, as he interprets it, <hi>in Apoc. homil.</hi> 11. two teſtaments, as the Church hath; <hi>but yet ſpeaks like the Dragon;</hi> that is, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets it, <hi>who under the name of a Chriſtian, pretends the Lamb, that he may ſpout in more ſecretly the poyſon of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon:</hi> and that harlot who makes all Nations drunken with the wine of her fornication, ſhould have <hi>a golden cup;</hi> that is, a ſhow of godlineſs, that he might the more eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. And <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith <hi>upon Matthew, treatiſe</hi> 28. <hi>and treatiſe</hi> 24. <hi>The Antichriſt holds nothing but the Name of Chriſt; neither doth he his works, nor teaches his truth. Chriſt is the truth, and the Antichriſt is a diſaguiſed truth, a diſaguiſed juſtice and mercy. He takes the teſtimonies of his falſe doctrine out of the Scripture, for theſe that will not be pleaſed otherwiſe; and he ſitteth upon the chair of the Scriptures, ſhowing himſelf as though he were God.</hi> And <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 7. <hi>That they teach deſpair under the pretence of hope, and perfidy under the pretence of faith, and the night for the day, and perdition in
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:106559:215"/> ſtead of ſalvation, &amp; the Antichriſt under the Name of Chriſt.</hi> So then if ye will believe either the Scripture, or theſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the Fathers, neither the ſtiles, nor yet the ſhow of godlineſs which your Popes have, will clear them from being the Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>And as to his humility towards men, we have heard ſomewhat of it before: And as to his humility to God, we ſhal hear of it hereafter, whether he be ſo humble as he pretends, or not. And certainly, it had not been poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that his ſpiritual idolatry and abominations had been ſo greedily drunken out by all Nations, if they had not been put in <hi>a golden cup, Rev.</hi> 17.4. and his deluſions had not been ſo ſtrong to deceive, and they had not been a <hi>deceiveable unrighteouſneſs,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10. <hi>and</hi> 11. that is, ſuch an unrighteouſneſs as had the ſhow of righteouſneſs, that it might the more eaſily deceive: and the doctrine of the Dragon had not been ſo eaſily and univerſally embraced, if he had not had <hi>two horns like the Lamb, Rev.</hi> 13.11. that is, the pretence of the Royal and Prieſtly authority of the Son of God. So he hath taken on theſe masks, that he may the more eaſily deceive. It is not then theſe viſards and masks that will be able to hide him from theſe whoſe eyes the Lord hath opened. And as for the third thing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints departed: I ſay, this argument is ſo far from clearing him from being an adverſary to God that if there were no more, it is ſufficient to convict your Popes and your Church, that they are adverſaries to God. For he is an adverſary to God who robs God of any portion of his glory, and gives it to his creatures: <hi>My glory</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>I will not give to another, Iſai.</hi> 42.8 But the Pope and his Church do ſo, in giving invocation or prayers (which is a part of Gods glory and worſhip) unto the Saints departed For the Lord ſaith. <hi>Call upon me in the day of thy trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:106559:215"/> Pſal.</hi> 50.14.15. Therefore your Popes and your Church are adverſaries to God in this point. For we ought to call upon them only, in whom only we ought to believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. But we ought only to believe in God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5. therefore we ſhould only pray to him through Jeſus Chriſt. And he only ſhould be called upon, who knows our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and is able to hear our prayers, and to grant them. But only God in Chriſt, the ſearcher of the heart, doth theſe things: therefore he only ought to be called upon. Here therefore ye give out a ſufficient evidence againſt your Popes and your Church, that you are Antichriſtian, and adverſaries unto God: For that which ye bring here to cleanſe him, doth fyle him.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, I will neither deny the hypocriſie nor idolatry of your Popes, for they both agree unto them: and that which <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith of the Antichriſt, is true of them: For they hold nothing of Chriſt, but his Name: They neither do his works, nor teach his truth. And yet for all their hypocriſie and pretence of godlineſs and humility, theſe notes and marks of the Antichriſt, as the Word of God hath deſcribed him, doth every way agree to them. So that if the Word of God be true in ſetting down the marks of the Antichriſt, your Popes who bear theſe marks, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity muſt be the ſame. You wiſh me in the end to read <hi>S. Augustin de Antichristo, tom.</hi> 9. It would appear that you think, that the reading of that work would have alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my mind ſomewhat concerning your Popes, that they are not the Antichriſt: and it appears to me, by that your earneſt deſire, that the doctrine ſet down in that Treatiſe, is worthy of all credit and authority, and that your ſelf is of that ſelf-ſame judgement concerning the Antichriſt with the Author of that Treatiſe: for I think you would not have wiſhed me to read that thing, which ye your ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not to be true, I therefore read it, and read it over
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:106559:216"/> again. And beſide many other things, I find this in it, that the Antichriſt ſhould be born of a Virgin, by the help of the Devil as Chriſt was born of the Virgin by the work of the holy Ghoſt. I wondered that you ſhould have wiſhed me to read that Book, in the which there was ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt an error, and that contrary the doctrine of your own Church. You ſhould beware of this <hi>(M. Gilbert:)</hi> for if your Head and Church get wit of it, they will not only count you a bad defender of the Catholick Faith, as you ſay you are: but alſo it may be they ſuſpect you of hereſie, who do wiſh your adverſaries to read that Book wherein ſo manifeſt an error is, and that againſt the doctrine of your own Church. For who will think of you, but that ye are of that ſame opinion your ſelf, ſeeing you are ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt with others to read the ſame. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> that great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of your Catholick Faith, was more wiſe then you in this point. For firſt, he ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Rom. Pont. cap.</hi> 12. <hi>There is a manifeſt error in that treatiſe.</hi> Next, he ſaith, <hi>It is certain that that treatiſe cannot be Augustins; but it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that it is Rabanus his work.</hi> So to conclud this, I aſſure you <hi>(M. Gilbert)</hi> I am of the ſame mind that I was concerning your Popes, for all the reading of that work: But I am not of the ſame mind towards you, that I was before the reading of the ſame: for either I think you have been very fooliſh in wiſhing me to read that which you believed not your ſelf to be true: or elſe, that ye defend a manifeſt error; not only againſt the truth, but alſo againſt the doctrine of your own Church. And let your Pope, who is the bond of unity among you, ſee to this, how to reconcile you and <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> two defenders of his Catholick Faith; you ſaying that that work is <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtins,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> flatly denying it, and affirming that it cannot be his: you wiſhing your adverſary to read it, and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confuting a manifeſt error in it. But betwixt
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:106559:216"/> you be it. Now this is all that you have ſaid for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe of your Pope, which are but as figg leaves, which cannot hide his nakedneſs.</p>
                  <p>Now I will let thee ſee (Chriſtian Reader) what we have for us, wherefore we affirm and teach, and is ready alſo (as thouſands have done before us) to ſeal it with our blood, <hi>that the Popes of Rome are the Antichrist,</hi> which the Scripture hath fore-told ſhould come, time hath made manifeſt, and the Lord his mouth hath in a part conſumed. And firſt, I will lay this ground which <hi>M. Gilbert</hi> cannot gain ſay, and the conſcience of all men will ſubſcribe to. That as the true Chriſt is ſufficiently deſcribed in the Old and New Teſtament, ſo the Antichriſt is ſufficiently deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed there alſo. And as he is to be believed, under the pain of the endleſs damnation of their ſouls, to be the true Chriſt, to whom the propheſies of the Old Teſtament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Savior to come, doth agree, and of whom the New Teſtament teſtifieth that they are accompliſhed: ſo he muſt be that Antichriſt which the Scripture fore-told was to come, to whom every one of the marks and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Antichriſt ſet down in the ſame, do agree, and in whom they are found to be accompliſhed. Let us therefore out of the Scripture ſearch the marks of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and then let us ſee whether their Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> be ſtamped with theſe marks or not. I ſpeak not now of the many Antichriſts whereof <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, 1. <hi>John</hi> 2.18. which were fore-runners of that great defection, which was fore-told ſhould come in the Church of God: but of that chief and great Antichriſt, who not in one or two things only, but almoſt in all the points of his Religion, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Jeſus Chriſt, whom theſe places of Scripture, 1. <hi>John</hi> 4.3. 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.13.17.18. do deſcribe. And while as I affirm, <hi>that the Popes of Rome are this great Antichrist:</hi> I underſtand it thus: That they are the Prince
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:106559:217"/> and Head of <hi>that defection and apostaſie,</hi> which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fore-ſhew and fore-told was to come in the Church. For I do not think that all the ſtrength and force of the Antichriſt is included in the Pope; but the Pope and his Kingdom which is contrary to the Kingdom of Chriſt, is moſt truly called the Antichriſt: whereof, becauſe the Pope is the Prince and Head: therefore by that figure, taking the part for the whole, I call him the Antichriſt. And in this we follow the Scripture: for the Scripture ſpeaking of the Antichriſt, ſometimes calls it, <hi>a defection,</hi> and <hi>a myſtery of iniquity,</hi> and <hi>the ſecond beast, that hath horns like the Lamb,</hi> and <hi>the Harlot:</hi> and ſometimes points out the principal and chief in this Kingdom, on whom the whole body of iniquity doth hang: as when he writes here, <hi>the man of ſin, and ſon of perdition, which is an adverſary, who extolls himſelf above all, &amp;c.</hi> which is moſt properly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, not of the body, but of the Head. Having ſhown now in what ſenſe we take the Antichriſt, we will go to the matter. And firſt, to that 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.3.4. where he is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and that by no dark propheſies, as you ſay, but by plain ſayings. Firſt, therefore, the Scripture calls him there, <hi>a man of ſin, a ſon of perdition.</hi> The which to be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in your Popes, your own Hiſtories, Cardinals, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Favorers, Friers, Friends, and themſelves, do ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently teſtifie. So that if they ſpeak true of themſelves (which you cannot deny) then of all the monſters that ever the earth hath born, ſome of your Popes have been the greateſt monſters. For in this point, <hi>M. Gilbert,</hi> we deal not with you, as ye deal with us: for ye cite our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as witneſſes of us, which ſhould have no credit; and we cite your own friends, and theſe of your own Religion. So that they ſhal be fetched out as witneſſes againſt you in this point, whether your Popes be the men of ſin, and ſons of perdition, or not. What Commandment is there of the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:106559:217"/> firſt or ſecond Table, which they have not violated in the higheſt degree? 1. Whoremongers. 2. Adulterers. 3. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domits. 4. Inceſtuous. 5. Foſterers and maintainers of harlots. 6. Tyrants. 7. Deviliſh, and Sorcerers. 8. In pride paſſing all creatures under heaven. 9. Atheiſts without God. 10. Perjured. 11. Burreaus. 12. Bawds, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of whores. 13. Sacrilegious. 14. Traitors. 15. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious. 16. Blaſphemous. 17. Parricides. 18. Poyſoners of Emperors, Senators, Cardinals, yea of their own pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and ſiſters. 19. Helpers of the <hi>Turks.</hi> 20. Drunkards. 21. Simoniacks. 22. Monſters. 23. Baſtards. 24. <hi>Arrians.</hi> 25. Idolaters. 26. And ſo contentious, that ſometimes there was two, ſometimes three, and ſometimes four, all Popes, ſtriving for the Popedom together. It were long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and tedious to bring in their monſtrous lives, as their own flatterers, Friers, Cardinals, and others of their own Religion, have written the ſame. I will therefore only ſet down a few for example, for the probation of this firſt point.</p>

                     <hi>Leo</hi> the third, he by his authority allowed, and by his Bulls confirmed a falſe and adulterous blood, which ſome lying deceivers affirmed to ſpring out of a certain wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Crucifix, to be the true blood of the Son of God, and cauſed a ſolemn feſtival day to be made to the honor of it. What horrible, both blaſphemy and idolatry was this? The Devil himſelf could not have done that which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh Pope did. The Serpent which deceived <hi>Eva,</hi> could not have perſwaded men that Chriſt Jeſus, who (as the Apoſtle ſaith) but <hi>once ſhed his blood, and is now in glory at the right hand of his Father,</hi> did ſhed his blood again, which this Pope confirmed and allowed.</p>

But <hi>Romanus</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Theodorus</hi> the ſecond, Popes, his ſucceſſors, they allow <hi>Formuſus,</hi> and abrogat the acts of <hi>Stephanus:</hi> and ſo did <hi>John</hi> the 10. by a Council of 74. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, reſtored the acts of <hi>Formoſus</hi> to the full, and abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated the acts of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> and condemned them. Yet for all this, <hi>Sergius</hi> the 3. having caſten down <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> the firſt out of his Papal ſeat, afterward did caſt him in priſon, where he died, and ſo obtained this Satanical ſeat by the help of <hi>Maroſia</hi> his harlot; he cauſes take out the body of <hi>Formoſus,</hi> which had lyen eight years in the grave, degrades it from the Pontifical honor, cuts off the three fingers which <hi>Stephanus</hi> the 6. had left, and with them caſts his carkaſs in the river <hi>Tyber,</hi> and abrogats his acts, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained anew them which was ordained by <hi>Formoſus,</hi> which

                  <p>Pope <hi>Landus</hi> he begets in adultery <hi>John</hi> the 11. before he was Pope, who afterward was Pope, <hi>Petrus Premon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratenſis teſtis.</hi>

                     <hi>John</hi> the 11. or 10. <hi>Landus</hi> his adulterous ſon, he by the means of <hi>Theodora,</hi> his impudent harlot, being then ruler of <hi>Rome,</hi> was firſt made Biſhop of <hi>Bononia,</hi> and then Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and then laſt of all, Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> with whom he wallowed himſelf in whoredom, <hi>Luitpran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>de imper.</hi> But he by the means of <hi>Maro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> his harlots daughter, is caſt in priſon, and there ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And her baſtard ſon, whom ſome call <hi>John</hi> the 12. whom Pope <hi>Sergius</hi> the 3. begat with her in adultery, is ſet up in the Popedom, and he governs the ſame in that accuſtomed filthineſs. So the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by harlots, as noteth <hi>Luitprandus lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. and was made an harlot, as it was propheſied of her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John,</hi> whom ſome call the 13. of that name, he is ſuch a monſter, that I know not if ever the earth did bear a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who had ſold himſelf to all ſorts of licentiouſneſs, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, inceſts, and moſt horrible cruelties, <hi>Luitprandus in lib.</hi> 6. declareth that. Of his Cardinals, of ſome he cuts out their tongues, of ſome he cuts off their hands, of ſome their noſes, of ſome their privy members. He is accuſed in a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of his own Biſhops before the Emperor <hi>Otho,</hi> that he did not communicat: that he ordained Deacons in ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: that for money he made children Biſhops: that he defiled virgins and ſtrangers: that he made the Palace of <hi>Lateran</hi> a bordel-houſe: that he drank wine to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: that in his gaming at the dice, he ſought the Devils help: that he committed a three-fold inceſt, one with two ſiſters, another with his fathers concubine, the third with
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:106559:219"/> his niece: therefore he was depoſed from his Popedom. But afterward by the help of his harlots, was reſtored to it again, having dejected <hi>Leo</hi> the 8. who was placed in his room by the Emperor. And laſt of all, in the very act of adultery, he is ſtricken through (as ſome ſay) by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, God giving out that ſentence againſt him, and ſo dies without repentance. Theſe are evil, but yet worſe (if worſe can be) did follow. For from <hi>Joan</hi> the 8. who was a woman Pope, and an harlot, for the ſpace of 156. years, (as Cardinal <hi>Turrecremata ſumma de Eccleſ. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. reckons) to <hi>Sylveſter</hi> the ſecond, who got the Popedom in the thouſand year of our Lord. For that ſpace, I ſay, the Popes, ſuppoſe they vowed holy chaſtity, yet they were ſold to all luſts, and lived in all licentiouſneſs, harlotry, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, inceſts, and in great contentions, cruelty, tyranny, and bribery: ſo that they might rather be called the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> then the Vicars of Chriſt. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebrard</hi> a Papiſt, ſaith, that for the ſpace almoſt of 150. years, from <hi>Joan</hi> the 8. who died 884. <hi>anno,</hi> after <hi>Genebrards</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, unto <hi>Leo</hi> the 9. <hi>anno</hi> 1048. about fifty Popes did revolt wholly from the vertue of their anteceſſors, and were Apoſtatical rather then Apoſtolical, and obtained the Popedom, ſome by money, ſome by force and bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: <hi>And ſo no marvel,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſuppoſe they were monſtrous, and entered not in by the door, but by the poſtern gate: Chronol. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>ſeculo</hi> 10. But from <hi>Sylvester,</hi> it appears that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil was then looſed in his full ſtrength and liberty: and the Antichriſt reigned then as a Dragon in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For from him till <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7. including them both, being 18. or 19. Popes, their own Cardinal <hi>Benno</hi> writes, that they were all Inchanters or Sorcerers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sylveſter</hi> the ſecond, a teacher of theſe deviliſh arts, he by a ſolemn bargan with the Devil, that if he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote him to the Popedom, he would give him both ſoul
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:106559:219"/> and body afterward, obtains the ſame. He had a copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in ſecret, which alwayes gave him anſwer of that which he demanded of the Devil. He asked of the Devil, how long he ſhould live? Who doubtfully anſwering him, that he ſhould not die while he ſaid Maſs in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> He rejoycing at that, and never being purpoſed to go to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> yet not being ware of the Devil his ſubtilty, on a certain day went to a certain place in <hi>Rome</hi> which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there ſaying his Maſs in that Temple, is ſuddenly taken with a fever, and knowing by the noiſe of the Devils, his death to be at hand, in the anguiſh of his ſoul confeſſed his devilry: and as <hi>Benno</hi> a Cardinal writes, he deſires his hands and tongue, and (as ſome other write) his privy members alſo to be cut off, with the which he ſacrificed to the Devil, and blaſphemed God. Now judge thou (Chriſtian Reader) whether this ſeat and throne, and office of the Popedom be of God or not, which the Devil can give, and hath given to men, and which men can obtain by devilry. And judge whether theſe men whom they call the Head, light, and foundation of their Church, be Chriſts Vicars, or the Devils Vicars, or not. Yea, judge whether they are the very men of ſin, and ſons of perdition, and the Antichriſts which the Scripture fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told ſhould come in the Church, or not. But yet this did not fear his ſucceſſors: for they followed his footſteps in theſe deviliſh arts, as witneſſeth <hi>Platina, Sabellicus, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateran, Benno</hi> a Cardinal, and <hi>John de Pineda, part.</hi> 3. <hi>lib.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Benedictus</hi> the 9 he was ſo skilled in theſe deviliſh arts of Magick, that before he was made Pope, in the woods he called upon theſe evil ſpirits: and by his devilry cauſed women to follow him, for to ſatisfie his filthineſs. He by theſe his deviliſh arts obtains the Popedom, and makes his former companions Magicians, his moſt familiar
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:106559:220"/> counſellers. But he fearing himſelf, ſold the Popedom unto his fellow Magician, called <hi>Joannes Gratianus,</hi> who was afterward called <hi>Gregory</hi> the 6. for 1500. pound. <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> ſaith, that by the judgement of God he is damned for the ſelling of his Popedom. So after he is depoſed, he is ſuffocat by a Devil in the woods, and ſo he periſheth. Of whom it is reported, that after his death, he was ſeen mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly to appear to a certain Hermit, in his body like a Bear, in his head and tail like an Aſs: and being asked how he was ſo monſtrouſly transformed? He anſwered, <hi>I wander in this ſhape, becauſe I lived in the Popedom without reaſon, without a law, and without God:</hi> (Out of thy own mouth thou art condemned.) There was ſuch tumults, contentions, and great ſlaughters for that throne, betwixt <hi>Sylveſter</hi> the 3. and <hi>Benedict</hi> his faction, that <hi>Benno</hi> a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal ſaith, The Church was rent in pieces, and by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, under the color of ſweet honey, was ſuffocat. And <hi>Platin</hi> a Papiſt, ſaith, That the good was oppreſſed and rejected; and they that might do moſt by pride and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, clamb up to that throne. But <hi>Gregory</hi> the 6. buyes the Popedom (as hath been ſaid) and ſo at one time there are three Popes, which have three ſeats in <hi>Rome,</hi> whom <hi>Platin</hi> calls, <hi>Teterrima monſtra,</hi> moſt ugly monſters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7. called otherwiſe <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> that moſt ugly monſter, he having by the means of <hi>Brazutus</hi> poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſix Popes his predeceſſors, to make a way to himſelf unto the Popedom, climbs up to that deviliſh throne that ſame night, without conſent either of people or Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. Of whom <hi>Benno</hi> a Cardinal writes, that he was a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Magician: that when it pleaſed him he would ſhake his ſlieves, and ſparks of fire would come out, whereby he deceived the minds of the ſimple. Of whom the ſaid Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal reports alſo, that coming to <hi>Rome</hi> at a time, he left his book of his Magical and deviliſh arts behind him
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:106559:220"/> through forgetfulneſs: and remembring himſelf, he ſends two of his moſt faithful ſervants about it, charging them ſtraitly that they opened not the book: but they, the more they were forbidden, were the more curious; and ſo opening the book, and reading it, behold the angels of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan appeared to them in ſuch a multitude, that ſcarcely did the two young men remain in their wits: and the Devils ſaid unto them, Wherefore have ye called us? Why do ye weary us? Tell us what we ſhal do, otherwiſe we will fall upon you? Unto whom one of them anſwered, Pull down theſe high walls which are near <hi>Rome.</hi> Who went and did it quickly, and ſo the young men came to <hi>Rome</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly terrified. This ſame Cardinal reports of him, that he ſeeking by many deceitful means to put down the Emperor, hearing that the Emperor reſorted often to a certain Church to his prayers, and having ſearched the place where he uſed to bow himſelf, hired a villain to lay great ſtones over the beams of the Temple where the Emperor prayed, that they falling on the Emperor, might cruſh him in pieces, and ſo it might be reckoned for a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of Gods judgements. But it fell not out ſo: for the ſtone being ſo heavy, fell backward upon him, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a table that was among the beams, the ſtone and the miſerable man fell down upon the floor of the Church, and ſo the miſerable villain is cruſhed in pieces, with the ſame ſtone which he had prepared for the deſtruction of the Emperor. The ſame Cardinal alſo reports, that he ſought a reſponſe of the Sacrament of the Lords body againſt the Emperor (as the Pagans wont to do at their Idols:) but when he got none, he caſt it in the fire. For the which cauſe the Biſhop of <hi>Porteous</hi> in open pulpit ſaith, that <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debrand</hi> and we ſhould be burnt quick. He excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. depoſed him from his Empire, and ſet up <hi>Rodolphus</hi> Duke of <hi>Suevia</hi> in the Empire, and ſent him a
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:106559:221"/> Crown with this verſe, <hi>Petra dedit Petro, Petrus Diadema Rodolpho.</hi> He looſed all his ſubjects from their oath of obedience to him, and forbad his Biſhops and Clergy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pain of excommunication, to acknowledge him. This Emperor with his wife and ſon, came in the Winter, and ſtood before his Palace bare-footed, three dayes, in linning clothes, and all that time could not get acceſs to this proud Antichriſt: who anſwered, that his Holineſs was not at leaſure. <hi>Antoninus</hi> and <hi>Vincentius</hi> ſay, that he granted to a Cardinal in the time of his death, that by the inſtigation of the Devil he ſtirred up hatred, enmity, and warrs among many. Of whom alſo Cardinal <hi>Benno</hi> writes, That ſeeing the Devil could not get Chriſt ſubverted by the Pagans, he labored to ſubvert his Name under the ſhape of a Monk, and pretence of Religion.</p>
                  <p>The moſt cruel, arrogant, and treaſonable tyrant Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, he continues a debate for that Sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Seat twenty years: firſt with <hi>Victor,</hi> then with <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalis, Calixtus</hi> and <hi>Innocentius,</hi> who were elected Popes, and ſucceeded one after another. He excommunicats the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> and Pope <hi>Victor.</hi> He betrays the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to the <hi>Souldan,</hi> ſends his picture to him, and writes to him to cut him off, if he would live in peace. He cauſed him to fall down on the ground, and to ſeek mercy, and then tramped upon his neck (the Monarch of the world) repeating that ſentence of the <hi>Pſalm, Super aſpidem &amp; baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſcum, &amp;c. Thou ſhalt walk upon the ſerpent, and the coka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice, and thou ſhalt tramp down the lyon and the dragon.</hi> (O blaſphemous mouth! for this is ſpoken only of Chriſt.) And when the Emperor anſwered, <hi>Not to thee, but to Peter.</hi> He replyed, <hi>Both to me, and to Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. that three-formed beaſt, of whom the common Proverb is, that he entered in like a Fox, rang like a Lyon, and died like a Dog: He moſt craftily deceived
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:106559:221"/> his predeceſſor <hi>Celeſtin,</hi> by cauſing one to ſpeak to him for many nights through a whiſtle, as though it had been the voyce of an Angel: <hi>Celeſtin, Celestin, renounce: for the burden is greater then thou art able to bear.</hi> The which the ſimple man believing, renounced the Popedom, and ſo he entered in his room: And having impriſoned the ſimple man his predeceſſor, he was ſuch a cruel Tyrant, that he perſecuted ſome of his Cardinals every where, ſpoyling them both of their livings, offices, and their heritages. He waſted and ſpoyled the places where they were reſet, ſo that they were compelled ſome of them to dwel in the woods, flying his cruelty. Some did venter upon the cruel hearted Pirats, thinking to find greater humanity with them, then with their holy Father the Pope. He was alſo without all Religion: for when the Archbiſhop of <hi>Genua</hi> upon Aſhwedneſday, upon his knees, bare headed, doing his ſervice in the Temple before the people: this holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looking on him took a great many of aſhes and caſt in his eyes, ſaying theſe words, <hi>Remember man, becauſe thou art a Gibellin, and with the Gibellins thou ſhalt return to aſhes.</hi> He nowriſhed harlots, he begat baſtards, he affirmed that no man ſhould judge him, though he carried a number of ſouls with him to Hell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> the 23. taught, that the ſouls ſeparated from the bodies, did not ſee Gods face while after the reſurrection. and ſent Friers to preach it. He was declared by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome</hi> (as <hi>Marius</hi> ſaith) to be an heretick, a Tyrant in the Church, and a perturber of the publick peace of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Benedict</hi> the 12. he bought from her other brother <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rardus</hi> with great gifts, a ſiſter of <hi>Franciſcus Petrarcha,</hi> to commit villany with. He nowriſhed many harlots, of whom it is written, <hi>Iste fuit verò laicis mors, vipera Clero, devius à vero:</hi> He was a death to the people, a viper to
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:106559:222"/> the Clergy, a wanderer from the truth.</p>
                  <p>One part of Chriſtendom, to wit, the <hi>Romans,</hi> make <hi>Urbanus</hi> the ſixth Pope: another ſort make <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeventh Pope, whereby was ſuch a ſchiſm, that it went to their ſucceſſors, and continued forty years. Theſe Popes did mutually by their Bulls excommunicat one another: they ſent infamous libels one to another, wherein they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led other mutually Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Antichriſts, Tyrants, Thieves, Traytors, Sowers of evil ſeed, and the ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> and that worthily. Now becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaith, that the Popes cannot err, and that their judgement is infallible, and their decreets moſt ſure: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if this be true, by their own teſtimonies they are he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, ſchiſmaticks, and Antichriſts, &amp;c. <hi>Illyricus</hi> teſtifies, that <hi>Theodoricus Niem,</hi> the Pope his moſt inward Scribe, faithfully ſet down the Hiſtory of the Schiſm of theſe Popes in three Books: wherein he ſaith, that he found the deviliſh craft of the Popes and their wickedneſs, whereby they horribly mocked God and Religion, vexed and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized over the Church of Chriſt, to be ſuch, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he had read, heard, and ſeen much of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before, yet having read that Book, he ſaw their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs was ten fold more then ever he would have ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. And therefore he ſaith, <hi>Truly now I aſſent unto the Canonists, who affirm, that the Pope is neither God nor man: for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they are incarnat Devils, and in malice and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, is worſe then Satan himſelf.</hi>

He committed vile inceſt and adultery both, with his niece <hi>Nicolaus Quercaeus</hi> his wife, who being deprehended in the very act by her husband, was ſo wounded by him, that he kept the mark thereof to his very end. He committed alſo inceſt and adultery with his own daughter <hi>Constantia.</hi> And that he might the more licentiouſly enjoy his beaſtly luſt with her, he poyſoned her husband, named <hi>Boſius Sforſia.</hi> He exceeded <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> and <hi>Commodus</hi> in filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, defiling his own ſiſter, niece and daughter.

                     <hi>Julius</hi> the third, what better was he? who againſt the will of all his Cardinals, made one <hi>Innocent,</hi> with whom he had done villany, Cardinal, and admitted him to his dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick familiarity. <hi>Vergerius</hi> writes, he abſtained not from his own Cardinals: and that he uſed ſuch horrible blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as the moſt vile bawds, and the moſt filthy villains uſe in the contempt of God. When he miſſed his diſh of bacon which was not ſet at the table, at the command of his Phyſician, he braſt forth in this blaſphemy: <hi>Bring me my diſh, al diſpetto de Dio:</hi> that is, <hi>In deſpite of God.</hi> Again, when he miſſed a diſh of a cold peacock, which he had
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:106559:224"/> commanded to keep to him, having other new roſted pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks, he vomit out moſt horrible blaſphemy againſt God. And when one of his Cardinals anſwered, <hi>Let not your Holineſs be offended at ſo light a matter.</hi> He replyed; <hi>If God was ſo angry for the eating of one apple, that he caſt out our firſt parents out of Paradiſe; wherefore ſhal it not be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me who is his Vicar, to be angry for a peacock, ſeeing it is far greater then an apple?</hi> Now let men judge, whether the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> bear this mark of the Antichriſt, or not; that is, whether they be men of ſin and ſons of perdition, or not. Much more might I have brought for the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of this point, as the thirty Schiſmes among their Church, which never Church had ſo many, their mutual contentions, ſtrifes, cruelties, exerciſed one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But I hope this will ſuffice to ſatisfie the conſcience of all men, that the Popes are that man of ſin, and ſon of perdition. And certainly if others had written their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, then men of their own Religion, their own flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and friends, it would have ſeemed incredible. But their own Writers have by Gods providence ſo diſcovered their abominations, that I think the conſciences of all men may be at a point in this. This for the firſt mark.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond property of the Antichriſt, as he is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in that ſame place, is <hi>to be an adverſary to God,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4. For as the Devil is called <hi>Satan;</hi> that is, <hi>an adverſary to God:</hi> ſo his chief Lieutenant Antichriſt, is called <hi>an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary;</hi> that is, oppoſed and contrary to God; and that not in life only, but in doctrine, Religion, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that not in one point only, but almoſt in all the ſubſtantial points thereof. The which mark the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> bear, and that not only in their lives, but alſo in the whole ſubſtantial points of Religion. And to make this clear, beſides that which hath been ſpoken, we ſhal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, and the government of his
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:106559:225"/> Kingdom ſet down in the Scripture, with the doctrine of the Popes, and the manner of their government, that the contrariety of them may be known: ſo that it ſhal be ſeen, that cold is no more contrary to heat, and black to white, then Papiſm to Chriſtianity, and the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Religion of Chriſt Jeſus. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt ſtands eſpecially in theſe two things: in the knowledge of his perſon, and in the knowledge of his offices. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I deſire to know nothing but Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. And Chriſt himſelf ſaith; <hi>It is life eternal to know thee to be the only true God, and whom thou hast ſent Jeſus Chriſt. John</hi> 17 3. The doctrine of the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> overthrows both. And firſt to prove this concerning his perſon, the Scripture te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies that Jeſus Chriſt is conceived of the ſubſtance of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and that he hath but one true body, made <hi>of the ſeed of David, and of the ſeed of the woman, Rom.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4 and not many: and that he is like <hi>unto us in all things, except ſin, Heb.</hi> 2.17. The doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is, that Chriſt Jeſus his body is made of the bread and wine in the Sacrament: &amp; their doctrine makes him to have as many bodies as there is bits of bread in the Sacrament; and not to be like his brethren in all things, except ſin: (<hi>Bellar. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Euchariſtia; fol.</hi> 399. <hi>Pope John</hi> 22. <hi>lib. orat. in ſcr. antidotarius animae:</hi>) for his brethren can be but in one place at once, with their own due proportion viſibly: But their doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation makes him to be both in heaven and earth at once: in heaven viſibly, in earth inviſibly: in heaven with his own quantity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, in earth without his natural proportion: and not in one place of the earth only, but in innumerable places thereof at once: ſo that this main foundation of mans ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (without the which there is no eternal life) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the truth of Chriſts manhood made of the woman,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:106559:225"/> is utterly defaced and overthrown, by the doctrine of the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> in making him to have infinit bodies, not made of the feed of the woman, but of bread and wine; or at the leaſt, made of two diverſe ſubſtances. And as they overthrow the doctrine of his perſon, ſo they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the doctrine of his offices. His offices are three: a Prophet, a Prieſt, and a King, which are all overthrown by them. As he is a Prophet, he hath revealed his Fathers whole will unto his ſervants, <hi>John</hi> 1.18. and hath left it in regiſter in his latter Teſtament; and hath forbidden to add, empair, or to alter the ſame, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a wo &amp; a curſe unto them that adds, empairs, or alters the ſame, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. and that becauſe it is <hi>ſufficient to make a man wiſe unto ſalvation, and to make the man of God perfect unto every good work,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.16. and becauſe <hi>it is pure and perfect, and eaſie to all them that will underſtand it; Prov.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.8.9 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 119. But they have many wayes corrupted this Teſtament of Chriſt, by mingling and adulterating the ſame. Firſt, in that they give divine authority to the Books called <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> which are humain, <hi>Concil. Trident. Seſſ.</hi> 4. Next, in receiving, and commanding others to receive traditions with <hi>equal reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and affection with the Scripture.</hi> Thirdly, in their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt <hi>Latin</hi> tranſlation, which they have made authentical, which ſome of themſelves confeſs have miſſed ſometimes the meaning of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Bud. annot. prior. in Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dect. Andrad. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Arias Montanus Tom.</hi> 8. <hi>Bibl. Reg. in praefat.</hi> Fourthly, in joyning with the Commandments of God, their own commandments, and that not as things indifferent, but as neceſſary to ſalvation, <hi>Concil. Trident. Seſſ.</hi> 6 <hi>cap.</hi> 10. Fifthly, in condemning all ſenſe and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the holy Scripture, but that which they hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 4. Laſt of all, in quarrelling the Scripture of imperfection, obſcurity and ambiguity, calling it dead and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:106559:226"/> dumb, like a noſe of wax. They therefore who have alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, added, and corrupted the Teſtament of Jeſus Chriſt, confirmed by his death, which he hath left in writ, for to inſtruct his Church in all things, and to make her wiſe to ſalvation, and perfect to every good work, doth ſpoil the Lord Jeſus of his Prophetical office: But the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath done ſo: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they ſpoyl Jeſus Chriſt of his Prophetical office.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they are no leſs ſacrilegious and injurious to his Prieſthood. His Prieſthood ſtands in two things. Firſt, in purchaſing unto us by the vertue of that one ſacrifice once offered up upon the Croſs, an everlaſting redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Next, in making continual interceſſion for us with his Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11.12, 15.24.25.26.27.28. the which both are overthrown by the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> As to the firſt, it is overthrown many wayes: as firſt, our Savior ſaith, <hi>That his ſoul was ſorrowful unto the death:</hi> and <hi>that he ſwat drops of blood, Matth.</hi> 26.37.38. and <hi>he ſent up ſtrong cryes and ſupplications, with tears, in the dayes of his fleſh, Heb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. and therefore he thriſe upon his knees prays, <hi>That if it had been poſſible, that cup might be removed from him, Matth.</hi> 27.39. And upon the Croſs, through the ſenſe and feeling of that wrath, he breaks forth in that complaint, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> All which do teſtifie, that he ſuffered more then a common death; to wit, the terrors of the wrath of God, which was due to the ſins of all the elect. But the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ranverſeth this doctrine of our ſalvation, and teacheth, that Chriſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not the wrath of God upon his ſoul: which if it be true, then Chriſt hath not payed our debt ſufficiently: for our debt was not only the natural death of the body, but the wrath of God upon the ſoul: and therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth ſhal die the death, Ezech.</hi> 18.20.</p>
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:106559:226"/>
                  <p>Secondly, the Scripture teſtifieth, that Chriſts death and blood is a ſufficient ranſom for our ſins, and a ſufficient ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction unto the juſtice of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10.14. <hi>John</hi> 19.28. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. 1. <hi>John</hi> 1.7. They by the contrary joyn to his ſatisfaction, the ſatisfactions of men, both in this life, and in the life to come: in Purgatory, and that not only for their own ſins, but for the ſins of others. What is this elſe, but to make themſelves in a part Saviors of themſelves, and Saviors of others alſo? Yea, what is this elſe, but to make themſelves God? For who can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the juſtice of God, but God himſelf?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as it hath been proved before, Chriſt offered up himſelf once, by ſhedding of his blood upon the Croſs, never to be offered up again, which hath purchaſed an everlaſting redemption, the which is the only ground of mans ſalvation. How they have overturned this by their abominable ſacrifice of the Maſs, and their ſacrilegious Maſs-Prieſts, I hope hath been proved ſufficiently before: ſo that they have both evacuat the vertue of the ſacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſs, in ſetting up another ſacrifice for the redemption of ſouls: And alſo they have ſpoyled him of the dignity of his Royal Prieſthood, in joyning unto him collegues and fellow-Prieſts, to offer up himſelf dayly in their pretended ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, as they ſpoyl him of his Prieſthood, ſo do they ſpoyl men of that redemption, righteouſneſs, and ſalvation, which his death hath purchaſed, both in the fountain, matter, and form thereof. The Scripture teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that the only fountain and efficient cauſe of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is Gods <hi>free love and grace,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>and</hi> 1. <hi>John</hi> 3.16. They teach, <hi>That an infidel by the works of preparation</hi> (as they call them) <hi>even done without faith, may procure and merit Gods favor, Maſuenda in diſput. Ratisb. cum Bucero &amp; Scholaſt.</hi> And alſo they joyn
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:106559:227"/> with the grace of God, mans free-will, as a party worker with it, as though God did not renew it being corrupted, or repair it being periſhed; but only relieve it, being weak, and raiſe it up being faint: by the which they abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh (if the Apoſtle ſpeak true, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. <hi>and</hi> 4 5.) the <hi>grace of Chriſt: for if our ſalvation be of grace, it is not of works;</hi> and if it be not of works, then it is not of grace, and ſo not at all. As to the matter of our juſtification, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture aſcribes it only to <hi>Chriſt his obedience and his death, Rom.</hi> 5.19. They by the contrary, ſuppoſe they grant that Chriſt hath fulfilled the Law, and perfectly ſatisfied God, yet they teach that this righteouſneſs of Chriſt is not our righteouſneſs by the which we muſt be juſtified, but they place it in our own works, and in our own merits. And of this comes the third, that whereas the Scripture teſtifies, <hi>that this righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed unto us by faith, Rom.</hi> 4.22.23.24.3.5.6.7. They acknowledge not this impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but placeth the form of our juſtification in the merit of our works: and ſo they ſpoyl man of righteouſneſs and ſalvation. For <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Pontif. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>That the imputation of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, is not required to our justification.</hi> And the Council of <hi>Trent. Can.</hi> 10. <hi>Accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them who ſay that we are juſtified, juſtos formaliter per Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti juſtitiam, by the righteouſneſs of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as they have ſpoyled Chriſt of the firſt part of his office of his Prieſthood, ſo do they ſpoyl him of the ſecond part thereof, which conſiſts in his interceſſion, in joyning with him innumerable Interceſſors and Mediators, as well of Angels as of Saints departed, at whoſe hands they ſeek all manner of grace, which is only proper to Jeſus Chriſt to give; and that not only for the vertue of the merits of Chriſt, but for their own merits and interceſſion. Every Pariſh almoſt among them had their own Patron: and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry malady, diſeaſe or calamity, their own Saint or Angel to run to.</p>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:106559:227"/>
                  <p>And as their doctrine hath robbed the Lord Jeſus of his Prieſtly dignity, and man of the benefit of eternal life pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed to him by the ſame: ſo have they robbed him of that glory and worſhip that is due unto him, in plucking away his glory from him, and giving it unto creatures. 1. As unto Angels: and 2. Unto Saints departed, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially unto the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> 3. Unto their relicks. 4. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to images of the Trinity, of the Saints, of the Croſs. 5. Unto things conſecrated, as water, oyl, &amp;c. 6. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, unto whom they give that worſhip which is only due unto God, as prayer, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip vows, ſacrifices &amp;c. So that if they may be juſtly called the Antichriſt, whoſe doctrine ſpoyls Chriſt of the office of his mediation, and man of his ſalvation purchaſed thereby, and God of his due glory, which man is bound to give him, for his creation and redemption; and ſets up other Saviors and Mediators, other Prieſts and Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors beſide him, and teaches another way of mans ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then he hath taught, and worſhip other Gods then the God that made heaven and earth, and after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then he hath commanded: Then I ſay, the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> may juſtly be called, and is in truth the Antichriſt and adverſary to God: For they are guilty of all this abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. And becauſe I know that the poor and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people, and theſe that are blinded with the ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions of that man of ſin, will not believe theſe things of him, and of his Church; but as <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Unleſs I ſee the print of the nails, and put my finger in the print of the nails, and put my hand into his ſide, I will not believe.</hi> Even ſo, unleſs they ſee their idolatry, and grope it, as it were with their hands, they will not believe it: therefore I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, for their conviction and information (that none of them that is ordained to ſalvation periſh) to let them ſee their idolatries, and to make them to grope their
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:106559:228"/> abominations, and that by their own Books. For I ſhal not ſpeak here begueſs; for that were great fooliſhneſs to alledge here any other thing then that which is written in their own Books, ſeeing he hath promiſed to give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, leſt he ſhould challenge me of lying of them. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt therefore (Chriſtian Reader) that I ſhal forge nor fain nothing of them, but ſhal only ſet down thoſe things which are to be found in their own writings. And firſt, in their ſervice and Maſs Book, <hi>ſecundum uſum Anglicanum, Horae beatae Mariae, &amp; ſuffragia, &amp;c. printed anno</hi> 1520. they pray to the Archangels and Angels, <hi>to defend them in battel: to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them that none condemn them: to keep both their ſoul and body from godleſs deſires, and from unclean cogitations: to keep their mind from pollution: to confirm them in the fear and love of Chriſt.</hi> Secondly, they pray to the Saints departed, <hi>That by their merits and interceſſion, they may be defended from all evils, obtain all gifts, and get eternal life.</hi> Yea, they ſeek of them, <hi>Defence in this world from all evils, and everlaſting life.</hi> And they pray <hi>to God the Father, that by their merits and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, they may be delivered both ſoul and body from Hell fire, and may obtain through their merits, faith, patience, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life.</hi> So not only they make them Interceſſors, but Mediators; at whom, and for whoſe merits, they ſeek ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And upon this ground came that Paganiſm which they have brought in the Church of God, whereby every Nation, Village, Family, every Eſtat, and every malady or affliction, have their own Saint to be a Patron for them. Upon the which alſo hath proceeded this canonizing of Saints; that is, to make men Gods. For they ſay, that this canonizing of them is, <hi>to let men underſtand that they ſhould be adored, and called upon,</hi> as one of their own Archbiſhops <hi>Antonius</hi> ſaith, <hi>part.</hi> 5. <hi>ſumma tit.</hi> 12. For he ſaith, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven things appertain to the canonizing of Saints. 1. <hi>To be reputed publickly to be a Saint.</hi> 2. <hi>To be prayed to by the Church.</hi>
                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:106559:228"/> 3. <hi>To have Temples and Altars.</hi> 4. <hi>To have offerings and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices offered to their honor.</hi> 5. <hi>To have a feſtival day.</hi> 6. <hi>To have an Image with a candle, in ſign of their glory.</hi> 7. <hi>To have their relicks.</hi> And they ſay, <hi>That they may be directly prayed unto with the Lords Prayer,</hi> which our Savior formed only to be ſaid to God the Father. Now how ſhal they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from vile idolatry in this? Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> ſaith, That <hi>to the worſhip which is only proper to God, appertains Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Altars, ſacrifices, feaſts.</hi> And <hi>Durandus</hi> a Papiſt, ſaith the ſame, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. If this then be true, which this Pope and this Papiſt ſay, how then can they be cleared from ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, that give unto Saints that ſervice, which by their own confeſſion is only proper to God, as Temples, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, Feſtival dayes? &amp;c. And what ſhal we ſay to <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> and <hi>Dominicus,</hi> two of their canonized Saints, in whoſe perſons they have done that lay in them to have aboliſhed the merit &amp; the Name of Chriſt? Of this <hi>Franciſcus</hi> they ſay in their Book of Conformities, <hi>That he is greater then John the Baptiſt.</hi> And preferring him in many things to him, they ſay, <hi>That John received the word of repentance of Chriſt; but Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcus,</hi> ſay they, <hi>received it of Christ, and of the Pope,</hi> quod plus eſt, <hi>which is more. Of John it was revealed by an Angel to his father what he ſhould be: but of Franciſcus it was revealed to his mother, and his ſervants by Jeſus Chriſt. John was like the friend of the bridegroom: but Franciſcus was like the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom himſelf.</hi> They ſay, <hi>He is better then all the Apoſtles: for they left but their boats; but he left all to his very hoſe.</hi> They call him, <hi>Typicus Jeſus, a typical Savior, a ſingular crucified one, who received in viſion the ſame wounds which Chriſt hath, &amp; ſuffered the ſame dolors: who is the way of life, who is the image of Chriſt, as Christ is the image of the Father.</hi> Yea, which is more, they prefer him to Chriſt Jeſus. They ſay, <hi>Chriſt did but pray, but Franciſcus by prayer obtained.</hi> They ſay, <hi>The Baptiſm of Chriſt forgives original ſin, but Franciſcus hood
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:106559:229"/> much more.</hi> It is written alſo upon the port of the Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers of <hi>Bloys,</hi> of this <hi>Franciſcus, That his ſin ſhal be ſought for, but it ſhal not be found,</hi> which is only proper to Chriſt. Now theſe are not particular opinions, but approved by the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 9. <hi>Alexander</hi> the 4. and <hi>Nicolas</hi> the 3. ordained all the faithful, under the pain of hereſie, to believe all <hi>Franciſcus</hi> marks. And their Books are ſet forth by their priviledges.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Dominicus, Antoninus</hi> who was of that Order, compares him with Chriſt, and in a manner prefers him to him, <hi>Hist.</hi> 3. <hi>pars, tit.</hi> 23. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>did raiſe in all but three from the dead. Dominicus raiſed three in Rome, and by his prayer reſtored forty to life. Chriſt after the reſurrection being immortal, went twiſe to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the doors being ſhut; but Dominicus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>having as yet but a mortal body, which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is more marvellous, went into the Church in the night the doors being ſhut, that he ſhould not waken his brethren, &amp;c.</hi> And ſuch like of the reſt of the miracles, wherein he not only compares, but in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner prefers him to Chriſt. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſaid after his death, all power is given to me in heaven &amp; earth. This power</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not in a little co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat to Dominicus, above all heavenly, earthly &amp; infernal things (&amp; that in this ſame life) for he had the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to ſerve him, the elements obeyed him.</hi> And in the end he applyes that which is only ſpoken of Chriſt in the 45. <hi>Pſalm, He is more beautiful then the ſons of men.</hi> Alſo he ſaith, <hi>That there was two Images, the one of Paul, the other of Dominicus. At the foot of Pauls Image, it was written, Per iſtumitur ad Chriſtum: By this man is the way to Chriſt. At the foot of the Image of Dominicus it was written, By this man the way is made eaſie to Chriſt. And marvel not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>at this: for the doctrine of Paul, and the reſt of the Apoſtles, induceth men to believe and to obey the precepts of Chriſt: but the doctrine of Dominicus induceth men to keep the counſels of Chriſt, and
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:106559:229"/> therefore the way to Chriſt by him is eaſier.</hi> So he prefers him to Chriſt in miracles, and to the Apoſtles. But what ſhal we ſay to that that follows? <hi>He is called</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus, becauſe he is like our Lord; and he hath</hi> poſſeſſive, <hi>and in poſſeſſion that which Chriſt hath abſolutly and by authority. Chriſt ſaith, I am the light of the world. The Church</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſings of Dominicus, Ye are the light of the world. The Prophets te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified of Chriſt, and ſo did they alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of Dominicus, and of his Order, as in the</hi> 11. <hi>chapter of Zachary, where it is ſpoken of Chriſt: I have taken unto me two rods, and I called one the ſtaff of beauty, and the other the ſtaff of bands. The ſtaff of beauty</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the Order of Dominicus: the ſtaff of bands, is the Order of Franciſcus.</hi> So they abuſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He compares him alſo with Chriſt, and in a manner, prefers him to him. <hi>Christ</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was born upon the bare earth; but leſt he had been over much hurt by cold, he was put into the crib by his mother: But Dominicus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>being in the custody of his nurſe, even then abhorring the pleaſures of the fleſh, was found oft-times lying upon the bare earth. When Chriſt was born, a ſtar appeared, ſignifying that he ſhould illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat the whole world: But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when Dominicus was born, his Godmother ſaw a ſtar in his fore-head; a prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a new light of the world. The prayer of the Lord was ever heard when it pleaſed him, but yet did not ever obtain that which he prayed for: as when in the garden he prayed, that the cup might be transferred from him: But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus deſired nothing of God, but that which he obtained per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly according to his deſire. Chriſt loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his blood: But Dominicus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing void of that perfection of love, he took a three-fold correction out of his own hand every day, not with a cord, but with an iron rod, even to the effuſion of his blood, and for his own faults, which were very few: another for them that were in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: the third for them that were in the world.</hi> And ſo deduces
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:106559:230"/> this compariſon through all the parts of Chriſts life. And in the end, he ſaith, <hi>That being to depart from this world, he comforts his diſciples, ſaying, Let not this trouble you, for in the place where I go to, I ſhall be more comfortable to you, then if I were with you: For after death ye ſhall have me a better Advocat then ye could have in this life.</hi> What blaſphemies theſe are, judge thou (Chriſtian Reader) and yet they are authorized by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe they ſerve to eſtabliſh the Popes ſupremacy: For <hi>Gregory</hi> the 9. ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized him as a Saint, <hi>anno</hi> 1223. and appointed a feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val day to be kept to his honor: And he that writes theſe things is an Archbiſhop of <hi>Florence,</hi> a man famous among them. To him that will joyn himſelf to this Order of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcus</hi> and <hi>Dominicus, for to merit the Kingdom of heaven, &amp; to redeem their own ſouls, or the ſouls of their friends</hi> (as their Bull of <hi>Fraternity</hi> ſaith.) The Provincial gives him the Bulls of <hi>Fraternity,</hi> by the which is made capable of all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Convent, &amp; of the merits of all the Friers of that Province, of their Maſſes, prayers, faſtings, abſtinences, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, watchings, diſciplins, &amp;c. Whereby (as though it were too little for them to be Saviors of themſelves) they teach that they have ſuch abundance of merits, as alſo may ſerve for others. They have a prayer to <hi>Thomas Becket, in their porteous book,</hi> who was made a Saint by <hi>Alexander</hi> the 3. in theſe words: <hi>Tu per Thomae ſanguinem, quem pro te impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, fac nos, Chriſte, aſcendere quo ille aſcendit:</hi> that is, <hi>Make us, O Chriſt, to aſcend to heaven by the blood of Thomas which he ſhed for thee.</hi> Mocking as it were the blood of Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Now as for the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> what title is proper to Jeſus Chriſt, which they have not aſcribed unto her? What honor or worſhip is given to Jeſus Chriſt, which is not given to her? <hi>Damaſcene</hi> ſaith, praying to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary, I ſhall be ſaved by hoping in thee. Thou is the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind. Antoninus</hi> ſaith, <hi>part.</hi> 3. <hi>ſumma tit.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp;
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:106559:230"/> part.</hi> 4. <hi>tit.</hi> 15. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. <hi>para.</hi> 7. <hi>That all they upon whom the Virgin Mary turns her eyes, are neceſſarily juſtified and ſaved.</hi> And that <hi>Chriſt becauſe he is both Advocat and Judge toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is too rigorous: for this cauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>God hath provided an Advocat</hi> (meaning of the Virgin <hi>Mary) in whom nothing is to be found but ſweetneſs.</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>The Seraphims willing to have retained Mary as ſhe mounted to heaven: Not</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>for it is not meet that man ſhould live his alone</hi> (ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the everlaſting Son of God, who ſits at the right hand of his Father) <hi>I am given to him for to be a help to that work of redemption by my compaſſion, and to that work of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by my interceſſion: to the intent, that if he threaten to deſtroy the earth, as in the time of the Deluge, I may appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him as the rain-bow, to the intent that he may remember his covenant.</hi> And which is yet worſe (if worſe can be) ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papiſt ſaith, applying that which is only ſpoken of Chriſt to her: <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſaid to her in her birth, I have given thee to be a light to the Gentils, to the intent that thou may be our ſalvation</hi> (applying it blaſphemouſly to <hi>Mary) to the end of the world, and a light to be revealed to the Gentils.</hi> And again he ſaith, <hi>That all graces which run down from the Father and the Son, come by her; who</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a Mediatrix be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and men: And no grace comes from heaven, but through her hands, and all grace enters in her, and comes out of her.</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>She is a Mediatrix of ſalvation, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, of justification, of reconciliation, of interceſſion, of communication.</hi> And to be ſhort, he ſaith, <hi>The Father hath given to her the half of his Kingdom, the which was ſignified in the perſons of Aſſuerus and Eſter: and that he hath retained to himſelf juſtice, and hath left to her to exerciſe mercy. So that we may appeal from the Court of the Juſtice of God, to the Court of the mercy of the Virgin Mary.</hi> Whereby they moſt blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly prefer and lift her up above the Lord: for that Judge unto whom appellation is made, muſt be ſuperior
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:106559:231"/> unto theſe Judges from whom the appellation is made: therefore they blaſphemouſly prefer the tribunal of <hi>Mary,</hi> to the tribunal of the God of heaven.</p>
                  <p>And what ſhal I ſpeak of her Letanies, Pſalteries, and Hours? Of her Hours, where ſhe is called, <hi>the Queen of mercy, who hath bruiſed the Serpents head:</hi> which thing is ſpoken only to the firſt parents of the Son of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>and the restorer and Savior of mankind: the moſt godly and most holy: the gate of heaven: the ſhining port of life: the mother of grace and mercy: our life, our hope; who makes the world to ſhine by the light of the brightneſs of her peace: who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath deſerved to be next in honor to the Trinity, by whom the whole world lives, next God.</hi> She is called, <hi>the comfort of the deſolat: the ſalvation and hope of all them that put their truſt in her: the fountain of ſalvation, grace, godlineſs, joy, comfort. The Queen of heaven, and ſtar of the ſea, whom the Sun ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors: the promiſe of the Prophets: the Queen of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts: the teacher of the Apoſtles: the comfort of the Martyrs: the ſalvation and conſolation of the quick and the dead: the bottomleſs fountain of all grace: the port of paradiſe: the Lady of glory: the Queen of joy: the Lady of Angels: the joy of the Saints: the only hope of the miſerable, the Empreſs of the Angels: the comforter of ſinners: the keeper of the heart: the praiſe of all the Saints.</hi> And of her is ſought in her Hours and Letanies, all theſe graces generally, which are only proper to God through Jeſus Chriſt to give: as <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, receiving in the time of death, refuge in the time of miſery, remiſſion of ſins, the keeping of ſoul and body, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life, ſtaying of the pest, calming of the ſeas, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in grace, the eſchewing of ſin, ſalvation and eternal life:</hi> And that by <hi>her merits and prayers their ſins may be forgiven; and that being redeemed by her, they may climb up to heaven.</hi> And they pray to <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>John Baptiſt, by the Redeemer,</hi> making Chriſt a Mediator between them and
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:106559:231"/> them. And they pray <hi>to Christ to defend them from his anger, and from the anger of his mother:</hi> And they pray her <hi>to give her ſelf and her Son unto them.</hi> What horrible blaſphemy is this? Who can give Chriſt, but only God the Father? They ſay, <hi>God will give them that worſhip her a reward here, and heaven hereafter. How ſhal I praiſe the redeemed by thee?</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Mary.</hi> And in the proſe of the Maſs, they have this prayer, <hi>Jure matris impera Redemptori:</hi> that is, By thy motherly authority, command the Redeemer. And as concerning her Pſalteries, how horrible is it to ſee all that <hi>David</hi> ſpake of the Father, Son, and holy Spirit, to be transferred and applyed to her, without exception, from the beginning to the end? changing only the ſtyle of the eternal Lord, in the ſtyle of our Lady, blaſpheming, <hi>Bleſſed is he who loves Mary, fears her, and praiſes her name, who hopes in her. The heavens declare thy glory, and the earth and the fulneſs thereof. Bleſſed are all they who love thee, becauſe thou haſt waſhen their ſins in thy mercies. Have mercy on me, O mother of mercy: and according to the bowels of thy compaſſions, waſh me from all mine iniquities. Save me for thy names ſake: Let Mary be lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up, and all her enemies will be ſcattered. Lord, give thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to thy Son, and thy mercy to the Queen his mother. Lady, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and life is in thy hand. O how good is God to them that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip his mother. God is the God of vengeance, but thou art the Queen of mercy. Come, let us worſhip the Lady: let us praiſe the Virgin who hath ſaved us: let us confeſs our ſins unto her. The Lord ſaid unto our Lady, Sit here, my mother, on my right hand. O man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind rejoyce, becauſe God hath given to thee ſuch a Mediatrix: and at the name of Mary, let all knees bow in heaven, in earth, and in Hell.</hi> This Lady Pſalter was compyled by a Cardinal of <hi>Rome, Bonaventure,</hi> who was canonized for a Saint by Pope <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> the fourth, <hi>anno</hi> 1470. After the ſame manner have they corrupted the Songs of the Prophets, of <hi>Simeon,</hi> and of the Virgin, blaſpheming after this manner, <hi>My ſoul rejoyceth in my Lady. My ſoul, magnifie my Lady, &amp;c. Now letſt
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:106559:232"/> thou, O Lord, the ſervant of Mary depart in peace, becauſe my eyes have ſeen the ſalvation of Mary.</hi> And to put an end to theſe abominations, they aſcribe unto the Virgin that which the holy Ghoſt hath ſpoken only of Jeſus Chriſt, the everlaſting wiſdom of his Father, <hi>The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his way: before he made any thing, I was ordained from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, Prov.</hi> 8.22.

                  <p>Not only have they ſpoyled the Lord Jeſus of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, interceſſion, and of his glory due to him, and mankind of their ſalvation purchaſed by his blood, in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing it to Saints, Angels, and to the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> but alſo in aſcribing them unto their conſecrat things, as their holy water, the tree of the Croſs, the ſign of the Croſs, their golden, ſilver, and ſtony Croſſes.

<pb n="402" facs="tcp:106559:234"/> the deſtroyer of hereticks, our joy in this life.</hi> Secondly, they pray to this Image, <hi>to purge us from all the ſpots of our ſins: to joyn us to the company of the bleſſed: to powr in light in our hearts by that vertue which is given to it: to increaſe our merit, and to lead us to heaven.</hi> When ſhal we tumble our ſelves out of the gulf of theſe abominations and idolatries? Blind now muſt they be that ſee not their doctrine to be the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Dragon. Therefore do I ſtrive with you (ſaith the Lord) and with your poſterity. For go through all the regions of the earth, and ſee if there be the like abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, as is among them. For they have changed the glory of God into unprofitable Idols. O ye heavens! be aſtoniſhed at this, and be confounded, and be ye deſolat. For two evils have they done: they have forſaken the Lord, and Chriſt his Son, the fountain of living waters, and have made unto themſelves broken pits, which can hold no water: that is, they have made unto themſelves falſe Gods and falſe Chriſts, which cannot bring ſalvation unto them. They have given his glory unto others, ſo that of all Idolaters that ever have been, they are the greateſt. It is no wonder therefore ſuppoſe the Lord hath cauſed it to be proclaimed by an Angel, <hi>That he that worſhippeth the beaſt and his image, ſhal be tormented in fire and brimſtone, day and night: and the ſmoke of their torment ſhal aſcend for evermore, and they ſhal have no reſt, Rev.</hi> 14 10.11. I hope now the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point is ſufficiently cleared, that they have ſpoyled Chriſt of his Prieſthood, and of that glory and honor that is due unto him.</p>
                  <p>Now as they have ſpoyled him of his Prieſtly office, ſo have they robbed him of his Kingly office. His Kingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſtands in two things: The one is, in the inward opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Spirit. The other is, in the exerciſe and miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Word, Sacraments and Diſcipline, which he hath ordained for that end. As for the firſt: He by his Spirit
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:106559:234"/> prepares the heart, by bringing us to a ſight and ſenſe of our miſery, that we may run to him to ſeek for mercy: And then he by his Spirit works that living faith, which makes us fully aſſured of ſalvation, which works by love, and brings forth the fruits of holineſs and righteouſneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of prayer is one ſpecial. All which is taken away by their doctrine. As to the firſt: No ſufficient knowledge of their miſery among them. For firſt their doctrine is, <hi>That we are not dead in ſin, but man hath free-will: and then, that concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence after Baptiſm, is not ſin: and that the adoring and worſhipping of Images, is not the breaking of the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. And that the reward of every ſin, is not everlasting death. And that men even without faith, may merit the favor of God; and that after they have obtained faith, they may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfill the Law perfectly, but alſo do more; yea love God with a greater love then he hath commanded, and lead a more ſtrait and heavenly life, then either the Law of God or man preſcribes,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith. <hi>And that men may not only ſatisfie God for their own ſins, and merit everlaſting life to themſelves, but alſo may communicat of the ſuperabundance of their merits unto others, Malvenda in diſput. Ratisb. cum Bucero, &amp; omnes fere Scholaſtici.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, is it poſſible that theſe men who ſo lift up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the conceit of their own righteouſneſs, can have the knowledge and ſenſe of their miſery? And as for this full aſſurance of faith without doubting, they call it <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</hi> And as for the fruits of holineſs, without the which no man can ſee God, let their fruits of their vow of ſingle life among their Clergy, and forbidding of marriage, which the Scripture ſaith, is the doctrine of Devils, bear witneſs: whereby innumerable abominations, murders, adulteries, whoredoms, have been committed in their Cloyſters and Nunneries, as their viſitation doth teſtifie. And in a fiſh pond there was found ſix thouſand childrens
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:106559:235"/> heads; which moved <hi>Gregory</hi> to revoke that determination of his, upon this reaſon, that it was better to let them mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then to give ſuch occaſion of murder, as appeareth by an Epiſtle of <hi>Hulderick</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ausburgh,</hi> written to Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> the firſt. And Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 2. ſaith, that marriage was taken away for ſome reaſons, but it ſhould be reſtored again for greater. This is aſcribed unto him. And as for true prayers, which ſhould be in the Spirit, with ſighs and ſobs that cannot be expreſſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. in a known language, with words of underſtanding, that men may ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> to them: in ſtead of this, they teach vain repetition and babling in prayers. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. as though God were ſerved by reckoning up their mutterings, ſo many <hi>Avees,</hi> ſo many <hi>Pater noſters</hi> upon a pair of beads, They teach to pray in a ſtrange language, which is <hi>a ſign not to them that believe, but to them that believe not,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not edifie nor build up, no not the tower of <hi>Babel</hi> it ſelf, ſuppoſe it be a tower of confuſion. So by their doctrine they have ſpoyled Chriſt of his ſpiritual government in the hearts of his own by the work of his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>And as for the outward government by the Word, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and Diſcipline, they have both ſpoyled him of it, and alſo have deprived the people of God of theſe means whereby their faith may be wrought, nowriſhed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in their hearts: For as for the Word, beſide their corrupting of it, what by <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> what by traditions, what by the commandments of the Church, what by their corrupted tranſlation, and their falſe interpretations, they have ſtarved the people of God for the want of them, in keeping them up in a ſtrange language, and reading them out ſo in their Aſſemblies in a ſtrange language; ſo that the people may have eyes and not read them, ears and not hear them, minds and not underſtand them, becauſe they are kept up in a ſtrange language. And therefore ſundry
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:106559:235"/> of our predeceſſors have been accuſed and burnt by them, for reading parcels of them, being tranſlated in the vulgar language. And as for the Sacraments, they have increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the number of them, by adding other five unto them: they have impaired them of their vertue, corrupted them with errors, polluted them with ceremonies, and have ſpoyled the people of the fruit of them, by reaſon they are miniſtred in a ſtrange tongue, and they have turned the Sacrament of the Supper in a propitiatory ſacrifice for the living and the dead. They have taken away the ſign of the Sacrament. They have aboliſhed the humanity of Chriſt, by their monſtrous tranſubſtantiation. They have taken away the Communion which ſhould be in the Sacrament, by their privat Maſſes: and they have ſpoyled the people of a ſweet pledge of their ſalvation, in taking away the cup from them, by their lamed communion under one kind.</p>
                  <p>And as for the diſcipline of Chriſt, they have renverſed it alſo, the order whereof according to the Scripture, is, that the Church of Chriſt be governed by his own Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and his own laws, ſet down in the Word, for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his people, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.30. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12. all which they have taken away. And firſt, concerning the Miniſters of Chriſt, Paſtors, Doctors, Elders, Deacons, which is given of God for the work of the Miniſtery and building up of the body of Chriſt, they have removed them from the government of the ſame, and have ſet up other Office-bearers, as Legats, Cardinals, Primats, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks, Archbiſhops, Lord Biſhops, Chanons, Parſons, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars, Archdeacons, Prieſts, Abbots, Provincials, Popes Inquiſitors, Commiſſioners, Officers, Procutors, Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the innumerable rout of their Monks, Friers, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits; whoſe Sects and Orders, as they have been reckoned
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:106559:236"/> by ſome, extends to an hundred and one, all different in Ceremonies and Orders one from another, all unknown in the Scriptures of God: and transformed the government of the Church of Chriſt into a viſible Monarchy and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as it is named by <hi>Turrian</hi> a Jeſuit, <hi>de Eccleſ. &amp; ordinar. Miniſt. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. And the Popes having ſet themſelves in the room of Jeſus Chriſt, the King of his Church, have not only tumbled out Chriſts Officers, and ſet in their own, of whom they exact an oath of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them: but have lifted up themſelves above the higher Powers, Kings and Magiſtrats, as ſhal be ſpoken hereafter. Claiming to themſelves both the Swords and authority, to give and to take Kingdoms at their pleaſure, exacting an oath of obedience of them, making them their vaſſals, and tyrannizing over the Church of God. And as they have ſhut out the Miniſters who ſhould rule the Church of God, ſo have they ſhut out his Laws whereby it ſhould be ruled. For this new Prince the Pope, hath ſhut out the Canon of the Scripture, from being a rule to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his Kingdom; and in ſtead thereof hath ſet down his Canon Law, Decrees, Decretals, &amp;c. which decretal Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>Gratian,</hi> the gatherer of the Canon Law, would have reckoned in the number of the Canonical Scriptures, <hi>Diſtinct.</hi> 19 <hi>in Canonicis.</hi> And to what end doth he uſe theſe laws? Not to further the ſalvation of Gods people, but to ſatisfie his own (if yet a horſe-leech might be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) and his Courtiers inſatiable covetouſneſs, ambition, and luſt. For this cauſe, he hath taken in his own hand the election of Biſhops, from them to whom it belonged. For this cauſe, he hath not permitted the cauſes of the Church to be debated where they roſe, as equity, reaſon, and peace would he ſhould have done: But he hath removed them thence to be heard at <hi>Rome:</hi> what by reſerving of cauſes to himſelf, what by appellations, what by
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:106559:236"/> exemptions: And for the ſame cauſe, he hath committed the feeding and guiding of the flock of Chriſt, to brute and beaſtly creatures, in giving the charge and commodities of the Church to whom he would, by preſentations, preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, reſervations, tranſlations, proviſions, permutations, and commendations. How hath he waſted and ſeized upon the Church goods, with his penſions, and firſt fruits and appropriations, ſo that he hath been cryed out upon of ryot, pride, extortion and ſimony? <hi>Ammian.

                  <p>And to end this, what ſhal I ſpeak of his tyrannical laws, whereby he hath oppreſſed the Church of God, as of ſingle life, auricular confeſſion, choiſe of meats, apparel &amp; dayes, of new and ſtrange canonizing of Saints, of pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to the holy Land, of the vows of Monks &amp; Nuns, of the eſtates and rites of marriage, and of innumerable ceremonies, partly unfruitful, partly fooliſh, partly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious?

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:106559:237"/> right and equity? That a brother may marry his own brothers wife (King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8.) and an uncle his ſiſters daughter (<hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain.</hi>) And Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth, approved the marriage of one with his ſiſter germain.

And laſt of all, what ſhal I ſpeak of his Indulgences and Pardons, in granting ſo many hundred and thouſand years pardon of their ſins, to them that will devoutly ſay their idolatrous prayers?

Some thirtytwo thouſand, ſeven hundred &amp; fiftyfive years pardon: And <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 4 hath doubled the time of this fore-ſaid pardon: And ſome ten hundred thouſand years pardon for deadly ſins, as Pope <hi>John</hi> 22. <hi>Portuus</hi> book of <hi>Sarum,</hi> printed <hi>anno</hi> 1520.

That is, <hi>Churches, Prieſts, Altars, crowns, fire, incenſe, prayers, heaven, and God, are to be ſold in the Church of Rome.</hi> To conclud this then, he is the Antichriſt whoſe Doctrine and Religion, Miniſtery and Diſcipline, is directly contrary to the Doctrine, Religion, Miniſtery and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:106559:237"/> Diſcipline of Jeſus Chriſt. Again, he is the undoubted An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, whoſe doctrine ſpoyls Jeſus Chriſt of the truth of his humanity, of his Prophetical, Kingly, and Prieſtly Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſets himſelf and others up in the ſame offices: and whoſe doctrine ſpoils him of the glory which is due to him only, for our creation and redemption, and gives it to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and laſt of all, he whoſe doctrine ſpoyls men of their ſalvation, muſt be that undoubted Antichriſt. But the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Religion of the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Clergy (as hath been proved ſufficiently) are ſuch. Therefore they are that undoubted Antichriſt, which the Scripture fore-told was to come. And this for the ſecond mark.</p>
                  <p>The third mark of the Antichriſt, is, <hi>That he exalts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above all that is called God, and is worſhipped;</hi> that is, above all powers and majeſties, both heavenly and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He ſaith not, <hi>Above God himſelf;</hi> but above all that is called God: that is, above all powers heavenly and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as hath been ſaid. He then is the undoubted Antichriſt, whom the Scripture fore-told ſhould come, who lifts up himſelf above all powers, as well heavenly, as earthly: (this you cannot deny, becauſe the Scripture ſo affirms.) But the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> have lifted up themſelves above all powers, both heavenly and earthly: the which if it ſhal be proved, then of neceſſity it muſt follow, that the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> are that undoubted Antichriſt. Now for proof hereof, we ſhal ſet none other upon their aſſiſe, to file or cleanſe them in this point, but their own Canon Law, their own Writers, their own Biſhops and themſelves. <hi>Antonius</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Florence,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Sum. part.</hi> 3. <hi>tit.</hi> 22. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>That his power is greater then any created power: and that it extends its ſelf to heavenly, earthly, and infernal things.

What
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:106559:238"/> needs more? This is conviction enough. But yet we will proceed and ſee how far he hath lifted up himſelf above all theſe. As for them in the earth, there are two ſpecial powers, the temporal power, and the ſpiritual power. He claims ſuperiority over both, as is manifeſt by their own doctrine. <hi>The Pope is over the world in ſtead of Christ, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. in ſum. part.</hi> 3. <hi>tit.</hi> 22. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>I am Ceſar, all the power in the heaven and in the earth is mine, Boniface</hi> 8. <hi>We affirm and define, that it ſtands all creatures upon the neceſſity of their ſalvation, to be ſubject to the Pope, Extra de majorit. unam ſanct.

And if this had been their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe only, and not their doctrine, this pride and arrogancy might have been imputed to the perſons, and not to the ſeat. But his doctrine is ſo, <hi>Author ceremoniarum, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>The Pope of Rome doth reverence to no mortal man. All men of whatſoever dignity or preeminence they are of, ſo ſoon as they come in the preſence of the Pope, ought to kneel thriſe down, and to kiſs his feet. The Emperor as ſoon as he ſees the Pope, with his bare head, kneeling to the ground, he worſhips him, and kiſſes his feet. The Emperor holds the ſtirrop, while the Pope leaps on.

The Emperor at the banket holds the water to the Pope to waſh his hands, and brings the first diſh to the Popes table.

                  <p>His power over heaven and all the powers therein. <hi>All power in heaven and earth is given to me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. <hi>The Pope hath ſo great power in heaven, that he may canonize any dead man, and place him among the Gods, and that against the judgement of his Biſhops and all his Cardinals:</hi> Clemen. 6.

<pb n="413" facs="tcp:106559:239"/> the faithful adoration, and kiſſing of his feet, which the Angel would not permit to be done to him by John,</hi> Anton. ibidem. tit. 22. cap. 5. What needs more now for the proof of this mark? Doth not he lift up himſelf above all that is called God, who claimes power over heaven and earth and hell? This they cannot deny: But I aſſume, their own Clarks, Doctors, Popes, and Bulls teſtifie this, which they cannot chooſe but confeſs alſo: Therefore of neceſſity the Popes of Rome have exalted themſelves above all that is called God, and therefore they are that undoubted Antichriſt which was to come, and now is come.</p>
                  <p>And as they have exalted themſelves above all heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powers, ſo have they matched themſelves with Jeſus Chriſt: for theſe things are only proper to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>To have all power given him: to have all things ſubject to him under heaven: to be greater then all the Angels: to receive that worſhip which the Angels refuſe: to command the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: to make laws: to bind the conſciences of men: to creat and inſtitut new Religions.</hi> And yet the Pope hath arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all theſe things to himſelf, as hath been proved: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is that undoubted Antichriſt: For he that makes himſelf equal to the Son of God, lifts up himſelf above all that is called God: this cannot be denyed. But the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have done ſo, in challenging to themſelves theſe things which are only proper to the Son of God: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt be the Antichriſt.

<pb n="415" facs="tcp:106559:240"/> judgement, will, and power; ſo doth he claim to him the ſelf-ſame worſhip and adoration which is only proper to God: This worſhip is only proper to God, <hi>To fall down before his feet, and to adore him,</hi> and therefore Satan craved it of Chriſt, and he refuſed to give him it: And <hi>John</hi> would have given it to the Angel, but the Angel refuſed it.

                  <p>What needs more? He muſt be blinded by God that ſees not the Popes to have lifted up themſelves above all that is called God, and is worſhipped. But yet I ſay further. He hath lifted up himſelf above the majeſty of God: Firſt, in making that to be Gods word, that is not Gods word, in decreeing the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> to be Canonical Scripture. And his Canon Law reckons in the decretal Epiſtles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Canonical Scriptures of God, <hi>diſtinct.</hi> 19. <hi>in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicis.</hi> Now what is this but to prefer his authority to the authority of God?

It is certain that there is no redemption out of Hell: 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. and yet the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> claim that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>to deliver ſouls out of Hell, and to make them Saints in heaven.</hi> It is impoſſible to God, <hi>ex injuſtitia facere juſtitiam,</hi> to make wrong to be right, becauſe the Scripture ſaith, <hi>He cannot deny himſelf, and he cannot lie, Heb.</hi> 6.18.

And ſome ſay, <hi>That he may diſpenſe that one may have me wives then one at once, in ſome caſes.</hi> Now what is this elſe, but to exalt himſelf above the Lord? And in a Sermon in the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> it is there ſpoken of him by one of his own Biſhops, <hi>That all power in heaven and earth, is given to the Pope; Concil. Later. ſub Leone, ſeſſ.</hi> 10. And that which is more, <hi>That in him is omnis poteſtas ſupra omnes potestates coeli &amp; terrae: All power above all powers, both of heaven and earth.</hi> And <hi>Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> ſaith, <hi>That they deſire to be feared more then God.</hi> To conclud this then, He that hath exalted himſelf above all powers in heaven, earth and hell: he that hath equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf with the Son of God, the Prince of glory, and with the majeſty of God, in ſtyles, authority, office and power: And he who hath lifted up himſelf above the Lord Jeſus, and above the majeſty of God, he muſt be that undoubted Antichriſt, which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: But the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have done ſo both by their practiſe, and by their doctrine, as hath been proved by their own teſtimonies: Therefore they are that undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Antichriſt who was to come. This for the third mark.</p>
                  <p>The fourth mark of the Antichriſt, ſet down by the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:106559:242"/> Apoſtle, is, <hi>That he fits in the Temple of God, as God.</hi> That is, in an eminent &amp; high place in the Church of God. So <hi>Jerome</hi> to <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> upon that place, and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> &amp; <hi>Thomas of Aquin</hi> a Papiſt, expones this place, and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. de civit. Dei, lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 19 expones this Temple to be the Church of God, wherein the Antichriſt ſhal ſit. For leſt men ſhould think that the Antichriſt ſhould be an open enemy to God, the Apoſtle ſaith, He ſhal ſit in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; that is, in the Church of God: as it is taken, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. where the Saints in <hi>Corinth</hi> are called the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. So the Antichriſt is fore-told to be an houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold enemy, and not a forrain ſo: and he ſhal withſtand Chriſt not openly, but covertly. And though he be a deadly enemy to Chriſt, yet ſhal he pretend that he is in the Temple of God; that is, a member of the Church: and that he hath a throne; that is, a high dominion within Gods Church. And therefore in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>A beaſt which hath two horns like the Lamb, Rev.</hi> 13.11. that is, who in outward ſhow is like the Lamb, pretending his power and authority. And as <hi>Primaſius</hi> ſaith, exponing that ſame place, <hi>Thoſe whom he ſeduceth, he ſeduceth them by hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrifie of a diſſimulat truth: for he ſaith, he were not like the Lamb, if he ſpake openly as the Dragon.</hi> And <hi>Augustin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Tract.</hi> 3 <hi>in Epiſt. Joannis; Let us not take heed to the tongue, but to the deeds: let the tongue reſt, and ask the life.</hi> Whereby it appears, that they alſo are Antichriſts, who deny Jeſus Chriſt in their life. And therefore (alluding to <hi>Judas</hi>) he is called <hi>the ſon of perdition,</hi> who not by open warfare ſhould oppugn Chriſt, but by a kiſs, as it were, ſhould betray him. And therefore he is deſcribed alſo under the form of <hi>a woman, an harlot, Revel.</hi> 17.2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2 whereby is ſignified, that he ſhal not be an open enemy in profeſſion, but ſecret and diſſimulat. And therefore the cup wherein ſhe reacheth out her abomination, is deſcribed to be <hi>of gold;</hi> that is
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:106559:242"/> having a ſhow of godlineſs. And his unrighteouſneſs; that is, his doctrine, is called <hi>deceiveable,</hi> becauſe of the ſhow of truth that it hath. And his iniquity is called <hi>a myſtery;</hi> that is, not a plain and open impiety, but ſecret: ſo colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſhows of truth and godlineſs, that every one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive it. And yet for all this hypocriſie of his, for all this diſſimulation, and ſhow of godlineſs. <hi>He ſhal ſpeak like the Dragon; Rev.</hi> 13.19. that is, his doctrine ſhal be the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Devils. His drink ſhal be <hi>abomination and fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> that is, abominable idolatry. Now to whom can this agree? And in whom hath this been fulfilled, except only in the Popes and Biſhops of <hi>Rome?</hi> For doth he not call himſelf, <hi>The Vicar of Chriſt: the head of the Church: and thoſe that obey him only the true Church, and true Catholicks?</hi> Who hath horns like the Lamb and yet ſpeaks like the Dragon, but he? That is, who ſtyles themſelves the <hi>ſervant of ſervants: the Vicar of Chriſt: the head of the Church, &amp;c.</hi> but they? And yet for all this, who have ever lived, taught, or ſpoken ſo blaſphemouſly as they? <hi>Oraclo vocis mundi moderaris habenas: Et meritò in terris crederis eſſe Deus.</hi> That is; <hi>By the oracle of thy voyce, thou rules the world, and worthily is thou believed in the earth to be God.</hi> This inſcription was written in <hi>Rome</hi> to Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth. In ſhow of holineſs, moſt vaunting; and yet for all this, of all the creatures under heaven, the moſt monſtrous. Of all idolaters, under the ſhow and pretence of Religion, the vileſt and moſt abominable: and of all creatures in the earth, they have lifted up themſelves far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt above God, and that under the pretence of humility. And therefore the Scripture ſaith, that the Antichriſt ſhal ſit in the Temple of God; not as a Miniſter teaching and preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdom, in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon: but as God; that is, claiming to himſelf theſe things that are proper and peculiar to God. The which the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have done, as hath been proved before.
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:106559:243"/> So to conclud this: He muſt be the undoubted Antichriſt, who ſuppoſe he hath lifted up himſelf above all that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God, yet he ſits in the Temple of God, as God: who hath two horns like the Lamb, and yet ſpeaks like the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon: whoſe abominations are drunken out of a golden cup, whoſe doctrine is deceiveable: and a myſtery: that is, who under the pretence of Chriſt, overthrows Chriſt: But ſo it is, the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> are ſuch (as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:) Therefore the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> are the undoubted Antichriſt. This for the fourth mark.</p>
                  <p>The fifth mark of the Antichriſt, as he is deſcribed by the Apoſtle, is in theſe words: <hi>Ye know</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>what withholdeth:</hi> namely, that he might be revealed in his own time. This <hi>Tertullian de reſurrect. cap.</hi> 24. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome ad Gelaſium,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> upon this ſame place, and ſo alſo <hi>Ambroſe</hi> upon this place, and <hi>Auguſt. de civit. Dei, lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 29. expone it of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: the which, as long as it flowriſhed, and was in full ſtrength, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt could not climb up to this his full hight and preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. So that it behoved that Empire firſt to be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and piece and piece diminiſhed, before the Antichriſt could come up to his hight; for that ſtayed him. Now it is manifeſt out of the 17. chap. of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be the ſeat of the Antichriſt: and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> do not deny it: and <hi>Rome</hi> was the ſeat of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire before. So then it behoved the Empire to tranſlate his ſeat from <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Rome</hi> which was firſt the ſeat of the Empire, might be the ſeat of the Antichriſt. Now the iſſue and event, is a ſure and clear interpretation of this Propheſie: For <hi>Conſtantin</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> tranſlated his ſeat from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Byzantium,</hi> called <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> in <hi>Greece.</hi> And piece and piece that Empire of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor began to decay, and was tranſlated from the <hi>Greeks</hi> to the <hi>French</hi>-men, by the Popes: and then from
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:106559:243"/> them to the <hi>Germans,</hi> by the Popes alſo. So that both <hi>Rome,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Italy,</hi> and at the laſt a great part of the Empire is fallen in the Popes hand. So that now he vaunts himſelf to be Monarch of the whole world; and all Kings and Princes gave him their oath of alleageance: and the Emperors and Kings held their Empires and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of him, and are but his vaſſals (as their Canon Law ſaith.) So that by the taking away of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the Popes did then climb up to their ſupremacy, and make themſelves manifeſt, that they were the Antichriſt. And ſo this doth alſo agree to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to none other. He is the Antichriſt, whoſe climbing up was let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and who is built up upon the ruines of the ſame. But the Papacy is ſuch: Therefore the Papacy is that Antichriſtian Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid, ſixthly, that <hi>this mystery began to work in the dayes of the Apostles:</hi> that is, the foundations of that apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie was begun to be laid in theſe dayes, and that he ſhal continue to the Lords coming: for he ſhal not be <hi>aboliſhed but by the brightneſs of his coming,</hi> ſuppoſe he ſhal be <hi>firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with the ſword of his mouth:</hi> that is, diſcovered, and ſore beaten by the Lords Word. All which agrees unto Papiſtrie. For that Kingdom is that Apoſtaſie and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Monarchy, whoſe foundation was beginning to be laid in the Apoſtles dayes, which ſhould be firſt conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Word of God, and utterly aboliſhed by the brightneſs of his coming. But the Papacy is ſuch: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that Antichriſtian Kingdom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.1.2.3.4. <hi>and</hi> 20.25.26.27. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.41. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 24. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2.3. For the foundations of it was ſoon laid, both of that Hierarchie and ſupremacy of the Pope, and alſo of his damnable and erroneous doctrine. For that ſuperiority of the Miniſtery one over another, of Biſhops over Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, forbidden by Jeſus Chriſt, ſoon crept in, which was
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:106559:244"/> the foundation, or rather ſtaires, by the which the Pope clamb up to his Popedom and ſupremacy: &amp; the old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned hereſies which ſprang up in the primitive Church, many of them were the foundation of theſe damnable doctrines, which the Popes brought in afterward, as is proved in the end of the firſt part.</p>
                  <p>And as to his conſuming by the Lord his mouth, the Lord hath accompliſhed that already in ſome meaſure, and ſhal aſſuredly fulfil it dayly more and more: For ſince the time of the burning of <hi>John Hus,</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> about the year of God 1415. and ſince the time the Lord ſtirred up <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> and ſundry others his faithful ſervants, to preach the Goſpel of Chriſt, which was as it were buried in the darkneſs of Papiſtry, the ſupremacy of the Pope hath taken ſuch a dayly conſumption, that many of the Kingdoms of <hi>Europe</hi> now have forſaken her, and the Lord hath put in their hearts to hate her: But yet we know the dreggs of it ſhal not be aboliſhed utterly, while the bright coming of the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>It followes ſeventhly, the manner how his Kingdom and tyranny ſhal be promoved, upholden, and eſtabliſhed: To wit, <hi>By the effectual working of Satan, with all power and ſigns and lying wonders, and with all deceiveableneſs of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs among them that periſh:</hi> Which the Apoſtle calles <hi>ſtrong deluſions.</hi> And with this, that of the <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.13.14. (in the deſcription of <hi>the ſecond beaſt,</hi> whereby it is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Antichriſtian Kingdom) doth agree, <hi>that he did great wonders, and deceived them that dwelt upon the earth, by the ſigns which was permitted him to do.</hi> Now certainly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſpoken more aptly of the Popes Kingdom then this: For unleſs the Pope had had an effectual po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, ſtrong and deviliſh alſo, by ſigns and lying wonders: and unleſs his <hi>unrighteouſneſs;</hi> that is, his falſe doctrine, had been exceeding deceiveable; that is, covered with a fair
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:106559:244"/> color of godlineſs: and unleſs his deluſions had been ſtrong, his Kingdom had never been ſo far enlarged, and ſo firmly eſtabliſhed, as we ſee it hath been: and his dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable doctrine and errors would never have de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eived ſo many Nations as they have done. For what is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and uſual in their mouthes then miracles? What is it they vaunt ſo much of, as of their miracles? So that they make it an infallible mark of the Church. And how, I pray you, have a great part of their errors and ſuperſtitions, as the praying to Saints, and worſhipping of Images, and pilgrimages, and other of their ſuperſtitions and idolatries, as Purgatory, the real preſence, their monſtrous Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, &amp;c. how, I ſay, have they been ſo confirmed and ſo rooted in the hearts of ignorant people, but by their lying wonders and miracles, which they fain was done? Whereof their golden Legends are full, and ſundry yet live, who have been eye-witneſſes of the falſhood of their miracles. I will only ſet down for example, ſome of the falſe miracles of two Nuns here: the one of <hi>Magdalena de la Cruz,</hi> Abbeſs of the Monaſtery of the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Nuns, who was condemned by the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> of <hi>Cordoua</hi> for her enormous offences, and covenant which ſhe made with the Devil, as they ſay in their ſentence againſt her. She by the aid of the Devil, with whom ſhe made a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant when ſhe was nine years old, became a ſingular hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crit, and by his help wrought many miracles, as that ſhe appeared unto Mariners in a ſtorm being invocated, and ſo the ſtorm calmed: that ſhe burnt in flames like <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims,</hi> and was raviſhed in the ſpirit, and heard wonders which mortal man could not utter: (In this ſhe was made another <hi>S. Paul</hi>) that ſhe was lifted up in the air, and the Sacrament went viſibly out of the hand of the Prieſt that ſaid Maſs, through the air, &amp; entred into her mouth: And when the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t went by, ſhe being in a garden, the wall
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:106559:245"/> of the garden opened its ſelf, and then ſhe worſhipped it: Such was the opinion of her holineſs, that many Ladies of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Empreſs, ſeeing themſelves at point of child birth, ſent their mantles wherein the creature ſhould be wrapped, that ſhe ſhould bleſs them. She gave to her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved friends drops of her monſtrous blood, &amp; made them believe it was the blood of Chriſt: ſhe was condemned as a Witch by the Inquiſitors of <hi>Spain,</hi> about the year of God 1540. The other of a <hi>Dominican</hi> Nun, <hi>Prioreſs de la Anunciada</hi> of <hi>Lisbon</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> about the 1586. year of God, that ſhe had deſerved to have Chriſt viſible for her husband, that he appeared to her often times, and talked with her, as one friend would talk with another: that ſhe had the impreſſion of Chriſts five wounds upon her. And as the hiſtory recordeth, other infinit miracles did ſhe. So that many became Nuns through the opinion which was conceived of her holineſs and miracles. This ſtory is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in French by one <hi>Steven de Luſignan,</hi> a <hi>Dominican</hi> Frier, and dedicated to the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> with this title, <hi>The great miracles and moſt holy wonders which this preſent year</hi> 1586. hath happened to the right reverend Mother Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs of the Monaſtery, &amp;c. in <hi>Lisbon,</hi> approved by Frier <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>Granada,</hi> and by other perſons worthy of credit in <hi>Paris,</hi> printed by <hi>John Beſſant</hi> 1586. He alledgeth three letters ſent from perſons of great credit for his warrant. But ſhe was diſcovered, and confeſſed her hypocriſie: and that ſhe painted the wounds on her hands, &amp; drew blood on her ſide, &amp; fained all the reſt, that ſhe might be eſteemed holy, and therefore was condemned by the Archbiſhops of <hi>Lisbon</hi> and <hi>Brage,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Guardia,</hi> the Inquiſitors, and ſundry others in the end of the 1588. year, as it is to be ſeen in a book printed at <hi>Sevil</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> 1589. Let theſe examples ſuffice to prove this mark, that by lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders they have eſtabliſhed their damnable doctrine. So
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:106559:245"/> that certainly there is not one thing that doth more confirm this, that their Popes is the Antichriſt, and their Kingdom Antichriſtian, then the effectual working of Satan by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonders, whereby their deviliſh doctrine hath been promoved and eſtabliſhed. And what ſeek we further? Is it not manifeſt by their own Hiſtories, that their own Popes to the number of 20. or mo, have wrought by the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual working of Satan? So then to conclud this point: If the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> be a true Prophet, which I truſt no man will call in queſtion, and if he be the true Antichriſt, to whom all theſe marks do agree: that is, who is the man of ſin, and ſon of perdition, who hath lifted up himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped, &amp;c. which cannot be denyed: then of neceſſity it muſt follow that the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> are the ſelf-ſame Antichriſt which was fore-told to come, becauſe they bear all theſe marks of that Antichriſt whom the Apoſtle deſcribes, and no other.</p>
                  <p>And if we will come to the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt is moſt clearly fore-told: What is there in that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> ſpoken of the Antichriſt, which is not fulfilled in the Popes of <hi>Rome?</hi> In the 13 of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> mention is made of two beaſts; by the firſt is ſignified the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, by the which the Saints of God were perſecuted the firſt 300. years: by the other is ſignified the Kingdom of the Antichriſt, which roſe up immediatly after the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing and deſtruction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: the which <hi>John</hi> calls <hi>another beaſt,</hi> diſtinguiſhing it from the former: which he deſcribes firſt from his outward form and ſhape, that he hath <hi>two horns like the Lamb, but ſpeaks like the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> which hath been accompliſhed in the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi> as I have ſhewed before. The ſecond from his works that he doth. Firſt, that he did all that the firſt beaſt could do before him. Secondly, that he ſhal cauſe all to worſhip the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:106559:246"/> firſt beaſt, whoſe deadly wound was healed. Thirdly, that he ſhould deceive them which dwel upon the earth, by the wonders and ſignes which was permitted to him to do. Fourthly, that he ſhould reſtore the image of the firſt beaſt. Fifthly, that he ſhould ſuffer none to buy or ſell, but ſuch as received his mark on their fore-head and hands. And the laſt thing from the which that Antichriſtian Kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (which is repreſented by the ſecond beaſt) is deſcribed, is the number of his name. All the which are ſo clearly accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in that Papiſtical Kingdom, theſe many hundred years, that he muſt be blinded of God, that ſees not that the Popes are the Antichriſt, and their Kingdom Antichriſtian.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt: Who have exerciſed all the power of the former Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> but they? Have not they claimed to themſelves the Monarchy of the whole world? The authority of both the ſwords? Have not Emperors and Kings ſworn their oath of alleageance and fidelity unto them, taking their unction, conſecration, and Crowns of them, and payed tribut unto them? Have they not kiſſed their feet, holden the ſtirrops, led their bridles, ſet them on their horſe? Have not the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated Emperors and Kings, depoſed them from their Kingdoms, ſtirred up their ſubjects againſt them, ſet up others in their places? And finally, what outward power or tyranny did ever the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors exerciſe over Kingdoms and Nations; yea, what cruelty, tyranny, ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, blaſphemy againſt God and his Saints, did they ever exerciſe, which the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have not done; yea, and have overcome them in all theſe things? The which are ſo clear and manifeſt, and that by their owne practiſes, that they cannot be denyed. Doth he not affirm in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law, <hi>Diſt.</hi> 96. <hi>cap. Conſtantinus, c. Venerabilem de ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio: That Conſtantin gave the Pope all the Kingdoms in the earth: And that all Kings reign by the Pope: And that he
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:106559:246"/> transferrs the Empire from Nation to Nation, and gives them to whom he will: And that all Kings are but the Popes vaſſals? Steuchus de donat Conſtant.</hi> And therefore ſaith <hi>Blondus, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>inſtau. Romae: Now the Princes of the world adore &amp; worſhip the Pope, as perpetual Dictator; not Ceſars ſucceſſor, but Peters ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, and the foreſaid Emperors Vicar.</hi> Yea, ſaith he, <hi>All Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope ſends greater, or at the least as great tribut to Rome, as they did in the former times</hi> (to wit, to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.) And <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſerm. de converſ. They are the first in the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (ſpeaking to the Church) <hi>which appear to love the primacy in the Church, &amp; to be Princes thereof.</hi> As to the ſecond, who is he that hath cauſed all to worſhip the firſt Beaſt; that is, hath brought again that tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nous cruelty &amp; dominion over the poor Church of God, in ſetting up idolatry, and aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the true worſhip of God, which the Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors did, but the Popes of <hi>Rome?</hi> For was not the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the Eaſt excommunicat, becauſe he would not ſuffer Images in the Temples? Have not they filled the world with their Idolatry, as hath been proved? Who have made war with the Saints &amp; oppreſſed them in all the parts where their dominion might reach, but they? <hi>France, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, England, Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> and all <hi>Europe,</hi> bear witneſs unto this. As to the third, who by lying wonders have deceived the world, but they? And as to the fourth, who hath <hi>healed the deadly wound of the first Beaſt,</hi> in ſetting up an Empire here in the Weſt in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> which was more then three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ſo deadly wounded through the incurſion of other Nations, that there was no Empire in the Weſt. Who (I ſay) did all this, but the Popes of <hi>Rome?</hi> Giving unto them the ſtyle or bare name, but taking by little and little the ſubſtance of the whole Empire to themſelves: ſo that <hi>Theodorick à Niem</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 43. <hi>The Roman Empire is ſo little now in Almany, that there is ſome Biſhops or
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:106559:247"/> Archbiſhops, that will ſpend twiſe as much as they will do of all the lands that is under their ſubjection. And ſome Princes have more land then the Emperor hath. And if ye will look to Rome</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and Italy, it was once the ſeat of the Empire, but now the Emperor hath nothing of it but the ſtyle.</hi> As to the fifth: Who is he who hath cauſed <hi>make the Image of the Beaſt, and given a ſpirit unto it that it ſhould ſpeak:</hi> That is, who have ſet up a very Image of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy and Hierarchy, in the whole frame of their government in the Church of God, but the Popes of <hi>Rome?</hi> So that the whole frame of their government and Hierarchy, is a lively pattern and image of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. For as in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, there was an Emperor whom all did worſhip as God: unto whom there was joyned a Senat, who was next in authority to him: ſo is the frame of the government of the Papiſtical Kingdom. There is a Monarch the Pope, whom all are compelled, when they come in his ſight, to worſhip as an earthly God, to whoſe ſentence all muſt ſtand to, who judgeth all, but can be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of none; who hath joyned with him a Senat of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, who are next him in authority. Secondly, as in the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, the Emperor took upon him not only the higheſt Kingly authority in all matters civil, but alſo the Prieſtly authority, and power over Religion: and not that only, but alſo to be Tribuns over the people, who had the power of forbidding and annulling of all decrees made by other Magiſtrats: Even ſo the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have uſurped all theſe three Firſt, the higheſt Royal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over all Kings and Princes: next, to be Lords over Religion: ſo that as <hi>Antoninus</hi> one of his Archbiſhops ſaith, <hi>Summa part.</hi> 3. <hi>tit.</hi> 22. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>He may creat new Religions:</hi> thirdly, to be Tribuns; that is, to diſanul whatſoever decree or judgement of any Biſhop or inferior Judges; yea of Synodal and General Councils, if they be not ratified by
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:106559:247"/> him. Thirdly, as in <hi>Rome</hi> was the head of the Empire, the Emperor and his Senat with him; and as the Emperors had their Magiſtrats under them, in all their Provinces, and places of their dominions, from whom all their authority was, and who was at their beck and commandment: So in the Popes Kingdom, the Pope who is the head, and the Senat of Cardinals, which is next him in authority, have their ſeat in <hi>Rome:</hi> and they according to the old pattern of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, have their Biſhops, Archbiſhops, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, Priors, Monks, Friers, &amp;c. in all the places of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion under them: who have their whole authority from him, and who all are his ſworn men. So here is then the lively image of the former beaſt.</p>
                  <p>And as to the ſixth, Who <hi>did kill all them that would not worſhip the image,</hi> and this frame of government of Popes, Cardinals, Biſhops, Archbiſhops, &amp;c. and their Religion, but the Popes of <hi>Rome?</hi> The blood of infinit thouſands do teſtifie this. And what hath brought all under their bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, both one and other, that none might buy or ſell: that is, neither brook Civil nor Eccleſiaſtical offices, but thoſe who were marked with his mark; that is, took on them his profeſſion, and was Catholicks (as he termes them?) Is not this ſufficiently known, that none might have offices nor benefices in the Church, but they that received his mark, &amp; orders from him? And none might brook their. Kingdoms and civil dignities, in ſo far as lay in his power, but theſe that were of his profeſſion. <hi>Rex venit ante fores, ſurans prius urbis honores: Poſt homo fit Papae, recipit quo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te coronam, Clement. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>tit.</hi> 9. And <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaith in his Adagles, <hi>That neither Baptiſm, nor marriage, nor ſacrifice, nor pſalms, nor prayer, nor Sacrament, nor grave in the Papiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Kingdom are given without money.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now laſt of all, to what Kingdom or Church under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſince this <hi>Revelation</hi> was written, doth the number of
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:106559:248"/> the name of the Beaſt, here ſet down, agree, but to the <hi>Latin</hi> Kingdom of the Popes, and their <hi>Latin</hi> Church? for here is ſet down the name of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Antichriſt. The number of the name of the Beaſt here ſet down, is 666. and the

So that there can be none under heaven unto whom they can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, but only to the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi> But yet for the full manifeſtation of this point, we will go to the 17. of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi> For as his Kingdom was figured under a Beaſt that had two horns like the Lamb, in the 13. chapter; ſo there is the principal throne and ſeat of his Kingdom, figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red under a <hi>great harlot, with whom the Kings and Nations of the earth have committed fornication.</hi> The which harlot is moſt gloriouſly decked and richly apparelled: <hi>Who hath a cup of gold in her hand, full of abomination: in whoſe fore-head a name is written: A Myſtery, that Babylon, that mother of whoredoms, who is drunken with the blood of the Saints and Martyrs of Jeſus; which is that great city, which reigneth over the Kings of the earth, which ſitteth upon ſeven mountains.</hi> For the maintenance of whoſe Kingdom, ten Kings yeelded up their power and authority, to fight againſt the Lamb, and to overcome him. That this great City is the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is ſo plain, that he is more then blind that ſees it not.

And in another place; <hi>It appears</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that in the time of the Antichrist, Rome ſhal be made deſolat, and ſhal be burnt, as it is gathered out of the</hi> 17. <hi>of the Revelation, and this ſhal not be until the end of the world.</hi> Theſe are plain ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. And I ſay, this great City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is called here myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> is not deſcribed here as ſhe was the ſeat of the Heathen Emperors, when they reigned in her, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſaith; but as ſhe is, and hath been the ſeat of the Antichriſt. For in the time of the Emperors, ſhe made not the Kings of the earth commit fornication with her: that is, ſhe did not pollute them with her idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Religion, as it is fore-told of this <hi>Rome:</hi> for ſhe left every Kingdom free to uſe their own Idolatry and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition: But <hi>Rome</hi> ſince ſhe began to be the throne
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:106559:249"/> and ſeat of the Antichriſt the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated her idolatry and worſhip to all Nations, and have made all Nations drunken with the wine of her fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and have obtruded her Religion to all Nations, againſt their will, with fire and ſword. And from thence have proceeded all the wars and blood-ſheds, in many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Europe,</hi> becauſe they did go out of her, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from their idolatry.</p>
                  <p>Further, all the parts of her deſcription here agrees to <hi>Rome,</hi> having the ſhow of Chriſtianity, and not as ſhe was Heathen under the Heathen Emperors, as that purple and ſcarlet wherewith ſhe was clad, that gilding with gold and precious ſtones, and pearls: which the Archbiſhop of <hi>Ratisbon, Albertus Magnus,</hi> and the Gloſs interprets of the ſimulation of piety and meekneſs, &amp; the ſpiritual graces of God, as faith, hope charity: all which (ſay they) ſhe ſhal in hypocriſie pretend: but yet in truth have nothing ſuch, but cruelty and ungodlineſs, the which can no wayes agree with <hi>Rome,</hi> as ſhe was in her Gentiliſm: therefore of neceſſity Papiſtical <hi>Rome</hi> is here deſcribed, and not Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Rome.</hi> Thirdly, that <hi>Rome</hi> is here deſcribed, which was upholden by the Beaſt, unto whom the ten Kings yeelded up their power to fight againſt the Lamb, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the 12. and 13 verſes of that 17 chapter. But this Beaſt is not the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Antichriſtian Kingdom: for theſe ten Kings had not received their Kingdoms all that time that the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors were Heathen, and long after: Therefore <hi>Rome</hi> as it is the ſeat of the Antichriſt, and not as it was the ſeat of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, is here deſcrybed. And the <hi>Rhemists</hi> ſay, in <hi>their annotations upon this place,</hi> that ſome expons theſe ten Kings, of ten Kingdoms, into which the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire ſhal be divided, which ſhal all ſerve Antichriſt: therefore <hi>Rome</hi> as it is here deſcribed, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Laſt of all, the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſpeaks here of that <hi>Rome</hi> that ſhal be burnt with fire, and be made deſolat by the ten Kingdoms, which God ſhould ſtir up to hate her: and he ſpeaks here of that <hi>Rome</hi> which ſhal be caſten in the midſt of the ſea: after the which ſhal follow the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But this cannot be <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was the ſeat of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, but as it is the ſeat of the Antichriſtian Kingdom: for it is more then a thouſand years, ſince <hi>Rome</hi> left off her Gentiliſm, and yet this propheſie is not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in her.

Arnulphus Arelatenſis</hi> unto the Council of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> teſtifigs this of the Pope; <hi>Whom</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Fathers, think ye this man to be, who fitting in an high throne,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:106559:251"/> ſhines in his purple and golden attyre? to wit, if he want love, and be puffed up by knowledge, he is the Antichriſt, fitting in the Temple of God, ſhowing himſelf as though he were God. Bernard</hi> 400. years ago, writing to <hi>Eugenius lib.</hi> 2 Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion he breaketh forth in theſe words: <hi>Thou hust more need</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to have a rake in thy hand, then a ſcepter to perform the office of a Prophet.</hi> And in another place, in his fourth Book to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> after he hath deſcribed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted the pride of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome;</hi> at laſt he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the matter in theſe words, ſaying to the Pope, <hi>Herein</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou ſhows thy ſelf to have ſucceeded, not to Peter, but to Constantin, Peter is he who never knew what belonged to ſuch ſolemn ſhowing himſelf abroad, in braveries of precious ſtones, or ſilks, or gold, or ryding upon a white palfray, or being gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a troup of tall fellows, or environed with a company of ruffling ſerving men.</hi> Alſo in another place, in his Epiſtle 230. ſpeaking of the tyranny of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he maketh an exclamation in this ſort; <hi>At the firſt indeed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye began to play the Lords but over the Clergy, contrary to the counſel of Peter,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. <hi>And within a while, contrary to the adviſe of Paul (Peters fellow Apoſtle) you will have dominion over the faith of all men,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. <hi>But ye ſtay not there: ye have taken upon you more; namely to have a peremptory power in Religion it ſelf. Now what remaineth whereon ye might further incroach, except ye will go about to bring the very Angels under your ſubjection.</hi> And in another place upon the <hi>Cant. ſerm.</hi> 33. ſpeaking of the behavior of the Romiſh Prelats: <hi>Hence cometh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that whooriſh tricking, that ſtage-like attire, that prince like pomp, which dayly we ſee in them: Hence proceeds the gold that they uſe in their bridles, ſadles, and ſpurrs; inſomuch that their ſpurrs are more glittering then their altars. Hence came their ſtately tables, their variety of diſhes, and quaffing cups. Hence iſſued their jonketting, banketting, their drunkenneſs and ſurſets. Hence followed their viols, harps, and ſhalms. Hence flowed their ſellers, and pantries ſo ſtuffed with wines, and viands of all ſorts. Hence got they their lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:106559:251"/> and painting boxes. And hence had they their purſes ſo well lined with coyn. Fy upon it. Such men they will needs be, and yet they are our great Maſters in Iſrael, as Deans, Archdeans, Biſhops and Archbiſhops. Theſe works of theirs are little inferior unto that filthineſs which they committed in darkneſs.</hi> And laſtly, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth theſe words, <hi>For he is the very Antichrist.

Eberhardus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salsburgh,</hi> above 380 years ago, <hi>Aventinus lib.</hi> 7. ſpeaking of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſaith: <hi>They only deſire to reign: They cannot abide peace: They will not ceaſe till they have ſtamped all under their feet, that they may ſit in the Temple of God, and be lifted up above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped. He who is the ſervant of ſervants, is the Lord of Lords, and deſires to be thought of, as if he were God.</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>That man whom they uſe to call Antichriſt, he ſpeaketh great things, as though he were God, in whoſe fore-head that name of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie is written, I am God, I cannot err. Franciſcus Petrarcha,</hi> a light of that age for his manifold learning, calls the Court of <hi>Rome, Babylon, and that harlot of Babel that ſitteth upon many waters, the mother of Idolatry and whoredom, the refuge of hereſies and errors.</hi> And <hi>Petrus Joannes</hi> pronounced <hi>the Pope to be the Antichrist, and the ſynagogue of Rome, to be
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:106559:252"/> that great Babylon.</hi> And <hi>Matthias Pariſienſis</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Antichriſt hath ſeduced all the Univerſities and Colledges of the learned, ſo that they teach nothing ſoundly now.</hi> And the Edict of the Empire, under <hi>Lodowick</hi> the fourth, ſpeaking of Pope <hi>John</hi> the 22. ſaith, <hi>Christians cannot keep the peace which is given them of God, for this Antichriſt</hi> (meaning the Pope.) And in another Edict it is written, <hi>As he is a diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed Pastor, ſo is he a myſtical Antichriſt: and we declars him being the author of that Antichriſtian Empire, to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of hereſie, and depoſed by our right by the Council ſentence, and common conſent of the Princes and Prelats of</hi> Germanie, <hi>the Prieſts of</hi> Italie, <hi>and people of</hi> Rome <hi>ſo deſiring.</hi> And <hi>Aventinus</hi> in the hiſtory of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> writes, <hi>That almoſt all the plain, juſt, ſimple, and upright have written, that then</hi> (to wit, when he was Pope) <hi>the Empire of the Antichriſt began, becauſe they ſaw that come to paſs at that time, which our Savior fore-told ſo many years before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to conclud this, <hi>Hadrian</hi> the 6. Pope, in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of his Legats to the Convention at <hi>Norimberg,</hi> he ſaith: <hi>Thou ſhalt ſay, that we grant freely that God hath ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this perſecution to come upon the Church for the ſins of men, and eſpecially of the Prieſts and Prelats of the Church.</hi> And again, he ſaith, <hi>We know that in this ſeat</hi> (ſpeaking of that Pontifical ſeat in <hi>Rome) many abominable things have been for ſome years, as abuſe in ſpiritual things, exceſs in commandments; and laſt of all, all things changed in worſe.</hi> And the Popes Cardinals (ſpeaking to <hi>Paul</hi> the third) ſay, <hi>From this fountain (holy Father) as from the Trojan horſe, ſo many abuſes have ruſhed into the Church, and ſo heavy diſeaſes, wherewith (as we may ſee) ſhe is brought into a diſperat eſtat.</hi> I omit the reſt Ye may ſee the truth is ſtrong that hath made their own mouthes to fyle themſelves. To conclud this then: He muſt be the undoubted Antichriſt, and his Kingdom Antichriſtian, unto whom the whole markes of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:106559:252"/> as he is deſcribed in the Scripture by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> doth agree: But they all agree unto the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Kingdom, as hath been proved. Therefore they muſt be that undoubted An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt who was to come. Secondly, he muſt be that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Antichriſt, whom his own Friers. Biſhops, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, and ſome of themſelves do call Antichriſt, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe theſe things unto him that belongs properly to the Antichriſt: But his own Friers, Biſhops, Cardinals, and ſome of themſelves have ſo teſtified, as hath been proved alſo: Therefore out of their own mouthes they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be that Antichriſt, and their Kingdom Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Now to put an end to this my reply, That Religion is falſe which hath neither unity, ſucceſſion, nor antiquitie: this you cannot deny, becauſe you make them the marks of your Church: But your Religion hath neither unity, for that is broken by your manifold contradictions and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among your ſelves, whereof I have marked ſome, and the diligent Reader of your works may gather many mo. <hi>Chrachtovius</hi> in his book called <hi>Bellum Jeſuiticum,</hi> hath gathered of two heads; to wit, the Maſs and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, 205. contradictions: let the Chriſtian Reader judge then what may be gathered of the reſt: no ſucceſſion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſonal, broken by their Popes, who was Atheiſts, Schiſmaticks, Hereticks, and by a woman Pope; neither in doctrine, being direct contrary to the doctrine of Chriſt: no antiquitie, for the authors and origine of ſundry main points of your Religion, is ſet down here: and all your <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, have not ſatisfied <hi>M. Jewels</hi> challenge theſe thirty years ago, concerning the novelty of twenty and ſeven of your opinions. Therefore, ſince it hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unity, ſucceſſion, nor antiquity, it is a falſe Religion, by your own doctrine. Secondly, that Religion which is
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:106559:253"/> contrary the Scripture, contrary the practiſe of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, which opens a door to all licentiouſneſs, which can bring no true peace and conſolation unto the conſciences of men, which bluſheth to be known and made manifeſt, which maintaineth many great abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, horrible blaſphemies, abominable idolatry, that is the doctrine of Antichriſt, and the doctrine of Devils, which by their own mouthes is condemned, muſt be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and falſe: But the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſuch as hath been evidently proved before: therefore it muſt be falſe. Wo therefore belongeth to their ſouls that profeſs it openly, or ſecretly.</p>

But, alace! there is very great decay of zeal and hatred againſt that Whore: that if our glorious Predeceſſors (whoſe excellent Motto it always was, <hi>No peace with Rome</hi>) were alive, they would wonder to ſee us ſo brutiſh and ſenſleſs, indifferent, and lukewarm, in ae matter of ſo great moment, wherein the honor and glory of God, the eternal happineſs and felicity of our own, and our posterities ſouls, and the ſafety and preſervation of Kings, Kingdoms, our lives, eſtats, and all that is near and dear to us, is ſo much and ſo nearly concerned: Therefore for letting us ſee our hazard in all and every one of theſe, as we have reviſed and republiſhed the above written excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Treatiſe of that learned, godly, and eminently zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and faithful ſervant of Chriſt <hi>M.

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was formerly moſt hateful to the Churches of Chriſt in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> not only becauſe of her moſt damnable and heretical doctrine, but alſo becauſe of the rebellious and treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable principles and practiſes maintained and committed by her againſt the perſons and authority of Princes, and peace of Kingdoms: her faith <hi>being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted faction, and her Religion rebellion:</hi> Therefore Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts of late have endeavored by all means to ingratiat themſelves in the favor of Princes and Magiſtrats, making
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:106559:256"/> ample profeſſion of loyalty and fidelity, and charging Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants with the odious crime of diſloyalty. And thus we ſee their late Writers, denying and diſowning the doctrine of Rebellion and Parricide, that our Divines have juſtly charged them with. For <hi>H T.</hi> the Author of the <hi>Manual of Controverſies, &amp;c.</hi> printed at <hi>Doway</hi> 1671 calleth it a loud ſlander, to charge Papiſts with maintaining, that if the Pope excommunicat a Tyrant, or heretical Prince, his own ſubjects may lawfully kill him.</p>
               <p>Therefore to unmask a little the bloody, rebellious and treaſonable principles of Papiſts, we ſhal prove: Firſt, that it is no ſlander, but a real truth, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holdeth, that if the Pope exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municateth a King, his own ſubjects may lawfully kill him. 2. That the Pope can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with the alleageance of ſubjects to their Princes: and if he ſo diſpenſe, then they are looſed from ſubjection and alleageance to them. 3. That no faith nor oath is to be kept with Hereticks. 4 That the Pope and Synagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> have been the Authors of warrs combuſtions and confuſions in Chriſtian Churches and Kingdoms all <hi>Europe</hi> over. 5. That their continual practiſe ever ſince the Reformation, hath been to plot and practiſe treaſons and rebellions, aſſaſſinations, and murders, both of Princes and people, who profeſſed the Reformed Religion. 6. That whereever they got the upper-hand and dominion in any Kingdom or Common-wealth they have practiſed moſt unheard-of cruelties, and barbarous inhumanities againſt the profeſſors of the Proteſtant Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>For the firſt and ſecond of theſe points; to wit, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts hold that if the Pope excommunicat a King his own ſubjects may lawfully kill him: And that the Pope can diſpenſe with the alleageance of ſubjects to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and if he ſo diſpenſe, then they are looſed from
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:106559:256"/> ſubjection and alleageance to them. I ſhal evidence it to be their commonly received doctrine, both by the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of their approved Doctors, and Bulls of their Popes, and their dayly practiſes. And leſt they ſay we wrong them, we ſhal (for the moſt part) ſet down the words of the Authors themſelves.</p>

That he may depoſe Emperors &amp;c. and transfer their Empires and Dominions from one line to another. That he may abſolve ſubjects from their oath of alleageance. That upon juſt cauſe be may ſet up a King in every Kingdom; for he is the overſeer of all Kingdoms in Gods ſtead. That it belongeth to the Pope to correct Kings when they offend.</hi> Much more hath this Author to this purpoſe.</p>

               <p n="2">2. But if the teſtimony of theſe two Doctors be not ſufficient, I hope the infallible judgement of two Popes <hi>è Cathedra,</hi> will abundantly convince that this is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Romiſh Church. The firſt is Pope <hi>Urban,</hi> who (<hi>Can.</hi> 23. <hi>quast.</hi> 5. <hi>Can. excommunicatorum</hi>) ſaith, <hi>We eſteem them not murderers, who being poſſeſſed with the zeal of their mother the Catholick Church, againſt theſe that are excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat, ſhal happen to kill any of them.</hi> The ſecond is Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth, who when he heard that King <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France</hi> was killed by the Monk, he went to his Conſiſtory, where before his Cardinals at <hi>Rome, Sept.</hi> 11. 1589, he had a Panegyrick Oration, which he began thus:
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:106559:259"/> 
                  <hi>Animo meo ſaepe, &amp;c. When I pondered in my mind, and was intent upon the thoughts of theſe things which lately have fallen out by God providence: I thought I might make uſe of that of the Prophet Habakkuk, There ſhal be a work done in your dayes, which none ſhal believe when it ſhal be told. The King of France is dead by the hands of a Monk: for to that may the words of the Prophet be rightly applyed, &amp;c.</hi> (a brave application of Scripture indeed.) And a little after, <hi>We with grief truly did often fore-tell, that as he was the laſt of his family, ſo he ſhould have an unuſual and ſhameful end.</hi> See more of this Oration cited by learned <hi>Hornbeck contra Bullam Pap. Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi> 10. Now can any Papiſt for his heart diſown this treaſonable doctrine, which the Pope approveth, except he diſown his faith and Religion? For doth not the faith and Religion of Papiſts depend on the Popes decrees ſo ſtrongly, and with ſuch a ſpirit of deluſion, that he can make the moſt peſtilent doctrines paſs with them for Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical truths; and the moſt abominable actions for pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of holineſs? For <hi>Bellarmin</hi> expreſly affirmeth (and no Papiſt that I heard of, did ever diſallow it) <hi>That if the Pope did err in commanding vices, or prohibiting vertues, the Church ſhould be obliged to believe that vices are good, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues evil, unleſs ſhe ſhould ſpeak againſt conſcience. Bellarm. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Pontif. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>And that in good ſenſe Chriſt hath given to Peter the power to make ſin to be no ſin, and that which is no ſin, to be ſin. Bellarm. contra Barclay, cap.</hi> 31. We can diſſent from the moſt eminent in our Church, when they hold any thing contrary to the Word of God: but ſo cannot Papiſts do with the Pope, whom they acknowledge to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But let us hear what H. T. ſaith further: <hi>We</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>abominat and deteſt that doctrine;</hi> to wit, <hi>that if the Pope excommunicat an heretical Prince, it is lawful for his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to kill him. For it is defined by the Council of Conſtance,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:106559:260"/> and therefore of faith with us, that it is heretical to affirm it law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cretals of your Popes, the Writings and Diſputations of your Doctors, and your actings and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes prove you a liar? Yea, if there were no more then the Acts of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> who condemned the Books of <hi>Bellarmin Suarez, Mariana, Santarella, &amp;c.</hi> to the fire, and baniſhed the Jeſuits the Kingdom, it were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to convince you of falſhood. 2. Whereas ye ſay, that the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> hath declared the doctrine of King-killing heretical, it is a mere forgery: For your great Doctor <hi>Suarez</hi> (who did write fifteen Volumes of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) ſaith to King <hi>James</hi> of famous memory, that the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> forbiddeth not the killing of a King excommunicated by the Pope. His words are: <hi>Ubi legit Rex in Concilio Constantienſi particulam illam Principis per Papam excommunicati vel deprivati, aut illam, per ſuos ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos, aut alios quoſcunque.</hi> The truth is, the caſe propounded to the Council by <hi>Gerſon,</hi> was not about the murdering of Soveraign Princes, but about the killing of a great Officer of the Crown, who ruleth tyrannically, and exalts himſelf above his King. For <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who had killed <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> pretended him to have been a Tyrant of that kind. So then Tyrants are declared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable perſons by the Council, who by its authority ſtrengtheneth them againſt their King. But although it were true that is alledged, to wit, that the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> had decreed againſt King-killing, yet who knows not that Papiſts make nothing of its authority: for none of the Popes ever liked it, much leſs confirmed it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His next excuſe is, <hi>That Mariana maintained the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of King-killing only problematically, and his book was condemned &amp; burnt by a Provincial Council of his own Order.</hi>
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:106559:260"/> Anſwer 1. <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi> tells another of your ſtamp uſing the ſame excuſe, that the Court of Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> compoſed of grave heads, did not underſtand it ſo, when they condemned his Book to the fire: neither doth he ſpeak of the murder of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third problema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, when he exalteth the murderer, in theſe words: <hi>Making a ſhow of delivering letters</hi> (to the King) <hi>he gave him a deep wound above the bladder with a poyſoned knife; which he hid in his hand. O admirable confidence of mind! O memorable action! by killing the King, he got to himſelf a great name.</hi> And in the ſame place he taxeth the Kings ſervants, who preſently killed that murderer, of cruelty and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs: <hi>Mariana de rege, &amp;c lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas he ſaith that a Provincial Council of the Jeſuits condemned <hi>Marianas</hi> book, the ſame <hi>Du Moulin</hi> anſwereth. But why then did the ſame General of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, who diſavowed it when deſtruction was hanging over the head of his Order, approve and licence it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? For the book was approved by <hi>Aquaviva,</hi> General of the Jeſuits, and <hi>Stephanus Hoyeda,</hi> Viſitor of their Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Province of <hi>Toledo:</hi> and the approbation mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that other Jeſuits had approved it before. But (ſaith he) ſee what that condemnation comes to: The Jeſuits ſeeing their ſect made odious by the writings of <hi>Mariana, Suarez, Vaſquez,</hi> and others, and more by the murdering of Kings, and for that cauſe expelled <hi>France,</hi> made an order among themſelves, whereby they forbade to write or teach that doctrine any more: The words of the ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are theſe, <hi>That none teach by writing or ſpeaking, that it is lawful f r any perſon, or upon any pretence of tyranny, to kill Kings and Princes.</hi> But how groſs is their fraud in that. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? Do they forbid their Society to believe ſo? by no means; but to teach ſo: neither will they have the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion done upon any pretence of tyranny, but only upon
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:106559:261"/> the definitive ſentence of the Pope, or the States: and how are the lives of Kings and Princes more ſecure then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by their declaring that it is not lawful to kill Kings and Princes, ſeeing that in their account they are no more Kings and Princes, when they are once excommunicated and depoſed by the Pope? <hi>Peter die Moulin ubi ſupra, cap.</hi> 5. Truly any that conſiders the Jeſuits temper, needs not to think it ſtrange that their General both approved and condemned <hi>Marianas</hi> book; for <hi>Doctor Rivet</hi> tells us that when the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> asked the Jeſuits in <hi>Paris,</hi> whither they were of the mind of their General, who had approved <hi>Santarellas</hi> book for King killing, and judged the things that are there to be certain? They anſwered, <hi>That living at Rome, he could not but approve what was there approved of.</hi> But ſay the Parliament, <hi>What think you?</hi> They anſwer, <hi>We think the clean contrary.</hi> But ſay the examiners, <hi>What would ye do if ye were at Rome?</hi> The Jeſuits anſwered, <hi>That which they do which are at Rome.</hi> So Jeſuits have one conſcience at <hi>Rome,</hi> another at <hi>Paris.</hi> Thirdly, nor was it <hi>Mariana</hi> his alone that was guilty of writing for King kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. For beſide theſe before cited, <hi>D. Rivet</hi> tells us that <hi>Ging<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ardus</hi> a Jeſuit, did write in praiſe of the murder of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third. And <hi>Albineus</hi> another Jeſuit, did hear the murderer of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth confeſs before he did the fact, and when he was examined upon it, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; <hi>That God had given him that ſpecial gift to forget, when once he had abſolved a ſinner whatſoever was confeſſed by him.</hi> Yea, there was ſo much wryting for, and acting of aſſaſſinations and parricids upon the perſons of Princes, that the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> did not only condemn <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> and <hi>Santarellas</hi> books to be burnt, as engins of treaſon and rebellion: but alſo did expel the Jeſuits the Kingdom, and ſet up a pillar of remembrance of their villanies.</p>
               <p>From all which I hope it is more then evident, that it is no
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:106559:261"/> ſlander, but a real truth that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holdeth, 1. That if the Pope excommunicat a King or Prince, his ſubjects may lawfully kill him. 2. That the Pope can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the allegiance of ſubjects to their Princes, and if he do diſpenſe therewith, they are looſed from ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them.</p>

               <p n="3">3. They not only looſe ſubjects from their allegiance to Proteſtant Princes, but alſo they hold and maintain that
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:106559:262"/> no faith is to be kept with Proteſtants becauſe condemned by the Pope and Council of <hi>Trent</hi> as hereticks, and ſo are fallen from the faith: and ſo forfeit all priviledges where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in keeping of faith with them might oblige others or ſtead them: and therefore let a Papiſt ſwear never ſo ſolemnly, and ingage himſelf never ſo ſtrictly by oath, compact, or covenant to a Proteſtant, he may break his oath, compact, and covenant to him without ſin, according to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. But becauſe that brazen headed impoſtor <hi>H. T.</hi> Author of the <hi>Manual of Controverſies,</hi> &amp;c denyeth this, affirming that Papiſts eſteem themſelves obliged to keep faith, even with infidels: therefore I ſhal prove the truth thereof.</p>
               <p>Firſt, who knoweth not that <hi>John Hus</hi> and <hi>Jerome of Prague,</hi> upon the Emperors promiſe of ſafe-conduct, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before the Council of <hi>Conſtance:</hi> But the Council declared that the Emperor was not obliged to keep his promiſe to them, becauſe no faith is to be kept to here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and therefore notwithſtanding of the Emperors let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſafe-conduct, they condemned them to the fire, and accordingly burnt them. Now <hi>H.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Not only did the General Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree this, but the Pope hath confirmed it. Now all Papiſts hold, that what is determined by a General Council and confirmed by a Pope, is of faith, and obligeth all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks Now that the Pope hath confirmed and allowed this, is moſt ſure: for Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 9 (whoſe Decree is extant in the Decretals. <hi>lib.</hi> 5 <hi>tit.</hi> 7. <hi>de haereticis, cap. u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Finally, their dayly practiſes confirm this. For Cardinal <hi>Oſſatu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> (as <hi>Hornbeck</hi> citeth him) tells us in his 87. Epiſtle <hi>ad D. de Villeroy,</hi> that Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 8. did preſs the King of <hi>France</hi> to joyn with <hi>Spain</hi> in the invaſion of <hi>England:</hi> and the Cardinal anſwered, that the King was tyed by an oath to the Queen of <hi>England:</hi> to which the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that (<hi>That the oath was made to an heretick, but he was bound in another oath to God and the Pope: and in end he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the ſaying of Franciſcus Maria Duke of Urbin, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every one doth blame a Noble-man, or great man that is no Soveraign, if he keep not his covenants or fidelity, and they au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him infamous: but ſupreme Princes may without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their reputation make covenants, and break them, lie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray, and commit other ſuch like things.</hi> Alſo Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 10. in his Bull againſt the Peace of Germany, <hi>anno</hi> 1651. doth annul and abrogat the oathes for confirming of Peace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As the Popes practiſes is a good example to Papiſts, ſo they follow their example to purpoſe, as I ſhal ſhow in ſome few inſtances. In Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Suffolk</hi>-men did aid, aſſiſt, and advance her to the crown; ſhe ſwearing to them that they ſhould enjoy the liberty of the Proteſtant Religion: but this principle, <hi>that faith ſhould not be kept to hereticks,</hi> induced her not only to break her promiſe; but alſo to impriſon ſome of them for minding her of it. How many fair promiſes did <hi>Katherin de Medicis</hi> Queen of <hi>France,</hi> and her ſon <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, make to the Proteſtants; and yet this helliſh principle induced them not only to break their promiſes; but alſo under the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt pretext of friendſhip, to maſſacre them all at <hi>Paris, anno</hi> 1572. It was this deviliſh principle that made <hi>Don Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> ſon to the <hi>Duke d' Alva,</hi> after he had taken <hi>Harlem</hi> upon compoſition, that the citizens ſhould give 24000. flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins to redeem themſelves and town from ſpoil, to plunder
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:106559:263"/> the whole town contrary to promiſe, and to hang ſome, drown others, and ſtarve others. It was this wicked prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that cauſed the Segnior <hi>Noucarmes,</hi> when the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Valenciennes</hi> in <hi>Hainault,</hi> ſurrendred the city upon good conditions, to keep the gates of the city ſhut for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe days, and moſt perfidiouſly and barbarouſly to hang up all the <hi>French</hi> ſouldiers, with all the Miniſters, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant merchants, and confiſcat their goods. Many mo inſtances might be given, but this may ſuffice.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding of all this, <hi>H. T.</hi> is ſo ſhameleſly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to ſay that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath declared, <hi>That to violate any leaſt point of publick faith given to hereticks, is a thing puniſhable by the law of God and man, Seſſ.</hi> 15.18. Anſ. I have conſulted <hi>Petrus Suavis</hi> on <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 15. and 18. and I can find no ſuch declaration, only there is a ſafe-conduct granted by the Council to Proteſtants to come to the Council: But they fearing leſt it was like the ſafe-conduct given to <hi>John Hus,</hi> did not accept thereof.</p>
               <p>The fourth evidence, to prove that no oath nor obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can bind Papiſts is, Becauſe, let Papiſts ſwear never ſo ſolemnly, whither for performance of fidelity to their Prince, or of keeping covenant and bargain with their neighbor, yet the Pope (according to their principles) may diſſolve that oath, and free them from the obligation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I might bring ſeveral proofs of this, but I ſhal only bring one very obſervable. After the Gun-powder trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon King <hi>James</hi> appointed that all Papiſts ſhould ſwear the oath of allegiance. But hear how <hi>Paſchenius</hi> in his anſwer to King <hi>James</hi> his monitory Epiſtle, ſcoffs at it (as <hi>D. Uſher</hi> citeth him in his Sermon before the Houſe of Commons, Feb. 18. 1620.) <hi>Vide in tantâ aſtutiâ quanta ſit ſimplicitas. See</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in ſo great craft how great ſimplicity doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray its ſelf: When he had placed all his ſecurity in that oath, he thought that he had found ſuch a manner of oath, knit with ſo
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:106559:264"/> many circumstances, that it could not with ſafety of conſcience by any means be diſſolved by any man. But he could not ſee that if the Pope,</hi> N. B. <hi>did diſſolve that oath, all the tyings of it, whither of performing fidelity to the King, or of admitting no diſpenſations, would be diſſolved together. Yea, I will ſay ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing that is more admirable: You know that an unjuſt oath if it be evidently known or openly declared to be ſuch, bindeth no man, but is voyd ipſo acto. That the Kings oath is injust, hath been ſufficiently declared by the Paſtor of the Church him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Ye ſee therefore that the obligation thereof is vaniſhed into ſmoke, ſo that the bond which by ſo many wiſe men was thought to be of iron, it become leſs then of ſtraw.</hi> So we may ſee that an oath upon the conſcience of a Papiſt, is like a collar upon an Apes neck, that he will ſlip on for his Maſters pleaſure, and ſlip off again for his own. Hence we may ſee what truſt and credit to give their pretences to loyalty, and their taking the oath of allegiance. For let Papiſts pretend to never ſo much moderation, yet they acknowledge the Pope as ſupreme in all ſpirituals and Eccleſiaſticks, and profeſs obedience to him before all the world in things of this nature. Now they all know that the Pope doth profeſs and publiſh both by doctrine and practiſe, that he hath power to excommunicat the greateſt Potentats, if hereticks, and to command all Catholicks in all things, <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia.</hi> That all Catholicks are bound to obey him under pain of damnation, in oppoſing their Soveraign without diſputing his commands: And ſo ſoon as a Prince is excommunicat by the Pope for hereſie, he is forthwith depoſed and deprived of his Princely dignity and ſoveraignity, and his ſubjects are diſcharged from all alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and are accurſed if they further obey him, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the afore mentioned Bulls of <hi>Pius</hi> the 5. <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. and <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 5. againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the writings of <hi>Bellarmin, Suarez, Allen, Sanders, Parſons,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:106559:264"/> Creſuel,</hi> and ſundry others Engliſh Papiſts; who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended theſe Bulls and poſitions even to death. In this caſe, a Papiſt muſt either caſt off his allegiance, or incurr the Popes curſe, and conſequently run on certain damnation. From which we ſee that (according to the principles of Papiſts) the Pope hath power to diſſolve all bonds, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, leagues and oaths, as he ſhal find conducing to the advancement of the Catholik faith: ſo that if he liſt, no bonds, humane or divine, no oaths never ſo ſolemnly taken, ſhal bind Papiſts: for when occaſion ſerveth, the Pope can and will relieve them from all obligations of God or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of nature and Nations, and they muſt ſubmit to him without contradiction or limitation. So that one cannot be a Papiſt, but if he underſtand his own principles, he muſt be a traitor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be ſaid, Although Papiſts maintain ſuch principles in reference to them who perſecute and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate Popery: yet if a Prince be favorable to Popery, and ſeek reconciliation with <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> there is no fear from them. Anſ. Let <hi>Simancha</hi> a Popiſh Doctor determine this. <hi>If Kings</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>or other Chriſtian Princes be turned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, their ſubjects are preſently fred from their dominion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhal they receive their right again, though they be afterward-reconciled to the Church. And as a King loſeth his Kingdom by hereſie, ſo his children loſe their right of ſucceſſion.</hi> His words are, <hi>Si Reges aut alij Principes Christiani facti ſint haeretici protinùs ſubjecti &amp; vaſſalli ab eorum dominio liberantur, nec jus hoc recuperabunt quamvis poſtea reconcilientur Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae. Et propter haereſin non ſolum Rex regno privatur, ſed etiam ejus filij a regni ſucceſſione pelluntur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To omit other inſtances, had not King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. of <hi>France</hi> experience of this in his own perſon? for he being a profeſſed Proteſtant &amp; perſecuted by the Leaguers, that he might enjoy the Kingdom in peace, was reconciled to
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:106559:265"/> the Fope, and went to Maſs. But was he the more ſecure or ſafe for all this, ſurely no: for not long after he was ſtob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the mouth by a Jeſuit. After which, for this and other of their treaſonable practiſes and writings, they were baniſhed <hi>France,</hi> and a pillar of remembrance of their villanies ſet up. But he to gratifie the Pope cauſed demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the pillar, and called them in again, telling the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the peril of it ſhould be on him: and ſo it was; for it coſt him his life, being ſtobbed by <hi>Ravillac</hi> through the very heart. And truly God ordinarly turns this policy to folly, whereof many inſtances might be given: I ſhal name but a few. The Eaſtern Emperors <hi>Justinian</hi> &amp; <hi>Phocas,</hi> the better to recover &amp; keep <hi>Italy,</hi> did the Popes much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and greatly furthered their ſupremacy: But they in requital ſoon after (by Gods juſt judgement) ſetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt their ſucceſſors in the cauſe of Images, made the greateſt part of <hi>Italy</hi> revolt from the Emperors obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. After this, <hi>Conſtantin</hi> the 7. and his mother <hi>Irene,</hi> to get the Popes favor, and to recover the Weſtern Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or at leaſt to keep what they had from revolting, with ſtrong hand eſtabliſhed worſhipping of Images in the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> But within twelve years the Pope crowned <hi>Charles the Great</hi> Emperor of the Weſt, and ſo they loſt the Weſtern Empire. Likewiſe <hi>John Paleologus</hi> Emperor of <hi>Greece,</hi> to procure the Popes favor againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> by the ſtrong hand induced the <hi>Greek</hi> Church to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile with <hi>Rome,</hi> and to acknowledge the Popes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in the Council of <hi>Florence anno</hi> 1439. But this was ſo far from advantaging him, that the Empire was loſt within 14. years after.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee that God in his righteous judgement tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſuch temporizing with the Pope, to the ruine of them that do it. The only way of ſafety, is to ſtand at the ſwords point. <hi>The eyes of the Lord run to and fro to ſhow himſelf

So this is the Pope and his Jeſuits method, when they cannot overcome any Prince, that they think no cordial favorer of theirs, by open hoſtility; they excite and ſtimulat ſome ſcholer or other of theirs, ſecretly to aſſaſſinat him. For <hi>John Chaſtel,</hi> a ſcholer of the Jeſuits, who ſtroke King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi> in the mouth, and broke out one of his teeth, intending to have cut his throat; when he was examined, confeſſed that he being guilty of a great crime, was kept priſoner by the Jeſuits in the chamber of meditations; where, after they had long terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his ſoul, they propounded to him a way to leſſen his torments in hell, to wit, to kill the King, which the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wretch promiſed and attempted: Whereupon the Colledge of the Jeſuits was ſearched, and many perſons ſeized on, among which was found a book in the praiſe of <hi>James Clement,</hi> the murderer of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3 written by the Jeſuit <hi>Guignard;</hi> containing many arguments and reaſons to prove it was lawful and juſt to kill King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. together with many incitements and motives to

Therefore he ſent over his Bull declaratory by one <hi>Morton</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, who bringing it to <hi>Rodolf</hi> a <hi>Florentin,</hi> divers copies of it were firſt ſecretly ſcattered among the Papiſts, and then the Brieve it ſelf fixed on the gate of <hi>London-houſe;</hi> by which time, the Prieſts, and other Agents for <hi>Rome,</hi> had wrought ſo far with ſundry Nobles and Gentle-men of eminency, whom they either found or could make diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the Reformed Religion, or Government, or whom they diſcerned to be ambitiouſly affected, that they never reſted, plotting one treaſon and rebellion after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

But that not taking

Baxter in his Key of Catholicks, chap.</hi> 45. <hi>&amp; ſeqq.</hi> proveth at large, that they plotted, contryved, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on that late change of Government in the State, and that cruel and abominable parricide committed on the Royal perſon of King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt. <hi>Peter du Moulin junior,</hi> Chaplain to the Kings Majeſty, <hi>in his vindication of the ſincerity of the Proteſtant Religion, in the point of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Soveraigns, chap.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 58.59 teſtifieth, <hi>That the year before the Kings death, a ſelect number of Engliſh Jeſuits were ſent from their whole party in England, firſt to Paris, to conſult with the Faculty of Sorbon, then altogether Jeſuited, to whom they put this queſtion in writing: That ſeeing the State of England was in a likely posture to change Government, whither it was lawful for the Catholicks to work that change, for the advancing and ſecuring of the Catholicks cauſe in England, by making away the King, whom there was no hope to turn from his hereſie? Which was anſwered affirmatively. After which the ſame perſons went to Rome where the ſame question being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and debated it was concluded by the Pope and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that it was both lawful and expedient for the Catholicks to promote that alteration of State. What followed that conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſentence, all the world knoweth.</hi> The ſame Author relateth, <hi>That when the news of that horrible execution came to Roan, a Proteſtant Gentle-man of good credit, was preſent in a great number of Jeſuited perſons: where after great expreſſions of joy, the greateſt of the company, to whom all gave ear, ſpake much after this ſort: The King of England at his marriage had promiſed us the reeſtabliſhing of the Catholick Religion in
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:106559:274"/> England, and when he delayed to fulfil his promiſe, we ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned him from time to time to perform it: We came ſo far as to tell him, that if he would not do it, we ſhould be forced to take theſe courſes which would bring him to his deſtruction. We have given him lawful warning, and when no warning would ſerve, we have kept our vow to him, ſince he would not keep his word to us.</hi> The ſaid Author likewiſe relateth, <hi>That in purſuance of the fore-mentioned concluſion at Rome, many Jeſuits came over, who take ſeveral ſhapes to go about their work, but most of them took party in the army. About thirty of them were met by a Proteſtant Gentle-man, between Roan and Deep, to whom they ſaid (taking him for one of their party) that they were going to England, and would take arms in the Independant army, and endeavor to be Agitators.</hi> Much more hath he to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. Baxter</hi> likewiſe proveth that many Jeſuits did enter in the army, and ſwarmed through the Countrey, under the name of Independants, Seekers, Quakers, Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, &amp;c. endeavoring to ruine the Reformed Religion, by railing againſt the Church, Miniſtery, Ordinances, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From all which it is evident, that the grand work of the Pope and Jeſuits his <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> is to plot and carry on treaſons and bloodſhed in Proteſtant Kingdoms and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, which they have been ſtill about ſince the Reformation: And no wonder the Prieſts and Jeſuits lay life and all at the ſtake, to accompliſh bloody and traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſigns, ſeeing they are ſworn and ingaged by oath to make this their work: For the Pope binds all the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, and Prieſts by oath to inculcat their principles of treaſon into their proſelyts, and to ſtir them up upon all occaſions to act it, as will be evident to any who will but read the rules of <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> the father of the Jeſuits: Or the teſtimony of Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the 8. in his Bull of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization of <hi>Ignatius Loyola: Touching that Society, that
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:106559:274"/> beyond all other fraternity, they are the chief and most ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous propugners of the Popes authority.</hi> And how far do the Jeſuits extend their vow of blind obedience? Even to the killing of Kings, raiſing of treaſons and rebellions whereever they can have acceſs. So that <hi>Watſon</hi> in his <hi>Quodlibets,</hi> and other ſecular Prieſts, have proven and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Jeſuits traitors, both for tenets and practiſe. But not only are the Jeſuits bound by oath to aſſaſſinations and rebellions, but alſo the ſecular Prieſts themſelves (who are not Jeſuits) are bound unto the Pope himſelf (in his Conſtitutions for ordering of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colledge at <hi>Rome</hi>) by oath to propagat rebellion: For thus ſpeaks <hi>Martin Aſpilcueta.</hi> Doctor <hi>Novarrus, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>conſil. &amp; reſp. concil.</hi> 1. <hi>de regular.</hi> (cited by Doctor <hi>Burges) At Rome in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Engliſh, it is a Statut and Papal Conſtitution, that whoever will be admitted into that Colledge, he be tyed to ſwear, that after ſo many years he will travel unto England for defence of the Catholick faith, and there preach it both in publick and privat.</hi> Now what Faith it is that they are bound to preach, the treaſons and rebellions raiſed by them can beſt evidence. Now their great work is to corrupt the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their followers, and inſtruments of aſſaſſination and treaſon, with poyſonous poſitions touching the nature of ſuch facts, and bribe their conſciences with ſtrong baits of reward and glory, to all that will undertake the acting of treaſons and rebellions at their inſtigation, which is a ſtrong incentive to them: For men that are either ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Religion, or deſirous of glory, will eaſily be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to any attempt, which is pronounced not only lawful, but noble and meritorious, for advancement of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And the Prieſts and Jeſuits perſwaſions, are the more forcible, by reaſon of the great influence they have upon Papiſts of both ſexes, and the power they exerciſe over their conſciences, and the eſteem and honor they
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:106559:275"/> have among them, becauſe that they do hazard their lives to do them ſervice, which doth exceedingly endear them to them, and makes them more apt to drink down any poyſonous principles that they infuſe. And ſo under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of Religion, they at their pleaſure involve them in deſperat treaſons. For whither will they not lead them by advancing the Popes authority over all, <hi>in ordine ad ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualia,</hi> and by dayly telling them that the Proteſtants are a pack of excommunicat and damnable hereticks, which all Catholicks are to look upon as ſuch, and ought to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them as the Pope ſhal command and direct? It would be too tedious to ſhow how often, and with what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they have excited up their followers to treaſons and rebellions. For what rewards have been promiſed to trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, if they do the deed, and what glory of Martyrdom they purchaſe in heaven, in caſe they miſcarry, is better known then I can declare. I ſhal only bring a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>Firſt, one <hi>William Parrey</hi> a Popiſh traitor, acknowledged, <hi>That he had promiſed at Rome to kill Queen Elizabeth, about which he was much troubled in his conſcience, till he lighted upon D.

                     </gap>wer and authority, even before any legal ſentence paſſ d by the Pope against him.</hi> To both which he added the infallible jugement of <hi>Clement</hi>
                  <pb n="485" facs="tcp:106559:275"/> the 8. who in two ſeveral Breves, one directed to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England;</hi> the other to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Garnet,</hi> enjoyned them not to permit any but a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prince to ſucceed Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Hence he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>He who then might lawfully he kept out, may now as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be thruſt out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pope Clement enjoyned the former: Ergo, we may do the latter.</hi> And thus armed with poyſoned Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he and his followers, reſolved moſt deſperatly to go on with that wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>Oneil</hi> firſt, and <hi>Tyron</hi> afterwards, had the publick approbation of the Univerſity of <hi>Salamanca</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they diſplayed their rebellious banners.</p>
               <p>From all which, the Reader may perceive in what a poor caſe any Prince or Republick ſtands into where Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have any power or ſtrength. Is not both the Kings life and his Kingdom and poſterity in dayly hazard of utter ruine and undoing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But leſt it ſhould be ſaid, that theſe were the the facts of ſome treacherous ſpirits, eſpecially the Jeſuits, who have been incendiaries, as well in their writings, as in their practiſes, yet the more moderat Catholicks have ever condemned theſe facts and writings: and many of them have been content to have granted to the King, all that the <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctors and Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> have granted to the King of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer 1. Theſe treaſons and rebellions have not only been done by ſome obſcure hot-brained Papiſts and Jeſuits, but alſo approved by their moſt learned &amp; approved Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; yea commended by the Pope himſelf, who (in their judgement is infallible:) For did not Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 5. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicat and depoſe Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and gave her Kingdom to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> (as we hinted before) which Bull of excommunication was confirmed by his ſucceſſors <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. and <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 5? And not only doth the
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:106559:276"/> Pope excommunicat and depoſe Kings, but alſo he doth approve of killing of Kings. For we told you before, that Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 5. gave thanks unto God in open Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, for the horrible murder and aſſaſſination committed by <hi>James Clement</hi> upon <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France;</hi> which Oration was publiſhed by the Papiſts and printed at <hi>Paris</hi> by <hi>Nicolas Neville</hi> and <hi>Rollin Thory,</hi> with approbation of their Doctors <hi>Boucher, de Creil,</hi> and <hi>Ancelin.</hi> And is not the fore-cited reſolution of Pope <hi>Urban,</hi> half an approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of King-killing, when he ſaith, <hi>He eſteemed them not to be murderers, who poſſeſſed with the zeal of the Catholick Church againſt theſe that were excommunicat, ſhould happen to kill any of them?</hi> And did not Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 5. permit <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> and <hi>Oldcorn</hi> (who were taken and executed in <hi>England</hi> for the Gun-powder treaſon) to be put in the Catalogue of Martyrs, their picture to be worn in medals, their image to be ſet upon the Altars in Churches, and their bones worſhipped as holy relicks? And <hi>Gerard,</hi> another of the Gun-powder traitors who fled, was permitted publickly to take confeſſions in <hi>S.

And doth not <hi>Franciſcus de Verone</hi> write an Apology in defence of <hi>John Chaſtel,</hi> who attempted the murther of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. of <hi>France?</hi> Now either the Papiſts muſt acknowledge theſe aſſaſſinations and murders to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or they muſt condemn the Pope as erring in approving of them, which will ſtrike againſt the foundation of their Religion to wit, <hi>That the Pope cannot err.</hi> Now therefore albeit ſome Papiſts in words profeſs a diſlike of Jeſuitical practiſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet ſtill they hold of the Pope for the whole frame of their Religion, and vow obedience to all his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick definitions, and ſo muſt approve of the moſt vile

               <p n="2">2. It is an ordinary ſtratagem of Papiſts to profeſs to abhor Jeſuitical tenets to lull us aſleep, to get their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs acted with leſs ſuſpicion. Among many, inſtances might be given: I ſhal give one in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, when after that Pope <hi>Pius</hi> his Bull came out againſt her, ſome ſeminary Prieſts admired and extolled that Bull, and blaſphemouſly ſaid, <hi>It was indyted by the holy Ghoſt:</hi> yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after they ſet out a book (on purpoſe to lull the Queen and State aſleep) to admoniſh the Papiſts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> not no practiſe any miſchief upon the Queen, becauſe Catholicks might uſe no other armes, but tears, prayers, watchings and faſtings, againſt their adverſaries, and yet in the mean time they never reſted plotting one treaſon after another. A liſt whereof I ſet down before. And even <hi>Watſon</hi> and other Prieſts, who did write againſt the Jeſuits rebellious practiſes, were the deſperat propounders and ring-leaders of that treaſon againſt King <hi>James</hi> and Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> at his coming to <hi>England;</hi> for which the ſaid <hi>Watſon</hi> and <hi>Clerk</hi> ſuffered the reward of traitors. So that H. T. and other Papiſts, are not to be believed; for they will ſay any thing, maintain any aſſertion, that they may make for the advancement of their cauſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What is the matter although they pretend to grant to the King all that the <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctors and Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> grant, yea what although they profeſs to ſwear their allegiance, are we the ſafer, ſeeing they change their principles according as they ſee occaſion, and ſeeing they hold that the Pope can diſpenſe with any oath, even after they have taken it, as I have proven before? And did not <hi>Parſons</hi> and <hi>Campian anno</hi> 1580. (notwithſtanding of their ſtrict oath to obey the Pope in all things) procure a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to free all Catholicks from obeying the Popes own
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:106559:277"/> declaratory Bull of excommunication againſt Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> till a better opportunity? So you ſee they can get a diſpenſation from the Popes own Bull, if they find it not ſeaſonable. What oath then will bind them, eſpecially to theſe they account heretical? For that is one of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. No faith is to be kept to hereticks, (as we ſhewed you.) They can change themſelves <hi>Proteus</hi>-like in any form. When there is no remedy, they will yeeld to any thing; But when they ſee their time, they will do any thing.</p>
               <p>I ſhal cloſe all with the teſtimony of two great Doctors and Biſhops in King <hi>James</hi> time, the firſt whereof is Doctor <hi>Andreus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> who in a ſermon on Nov. 5. 1616. ſpeaking of the reaſon that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> gives, why the primitive Chriſtians did not riſe up againſt perſecuting Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors. <hi>id fuit quia deerant vires;</hi> 
                  <q>He makes this collection, that is as much as to ſay, if they now in theſe days be ſo as they were then, and carry themſelves quietly, it is <hi>quia non ſunt vires:</hi> and to hold no longer, then <hi>donec erunt:</hi> And then you are like to hear of them, to have them go again with ſuch another birth. Ye ſhal have them as myld as <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, when they have no ſtrength: But as fierce as <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7. when they have: and afterwards thus.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>See ye not next under God, whereto to aſcribe your ſafety? even to <hi>non erant vires,</hi> there is a point hangs on that: for while that laſts, while ye keep them there, ye ſhal have the primitive Church of them: have them to ly as quiet, as ſtill, as ever did the barrels in the vault, till <hi>vires,</hi> like fire come to them, and then off go they: then nothing but depoſe Kings, diſpoſe of Kingdoms, aſſoil ſubjects, arm them againſt their Soveraigns: then do they care not what: But if the powder take not fire, then ſhal you ſtraight have books tending to mitigation; then all quiet again: certainly, thus ſtanding it were beſt to
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:106559:277"/> hold them <hi>in defectu virium,</hi> to provide, <hi>ut ne ſint,</hi> to keep them at <hi>non ſunt vires,</hi> till time they be better min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this point: and we have good aſſurance of it: for minded as they are, they want no will, no <hi>virus,</hi> they tell us what the matter is; ſtrength they want; they write it, they print it: and <hi>ſi adeſſent vires,</hi> they would act it in earneſt.</q> Thus he.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> in a Sermon on Nov. the 5. who having reckoned up a Catalogue of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable doctrines of Popery, profeſſeth to have done it. <q>To make it appear to theſe that would willingly be better perſwaded of their doctrine, that the doctrine it ſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly warranteth treaſon. Let the traitors be what they will, and that none can be an abſolut Papiſt, but (if he throughl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thus I hope ye have it proved, both from their principles and practiſe, that if Popery or Papiſts, get any ſtrength or footing in a Kingdom, it will tend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly to the ruine of both King and Kingdom. Yet the Papiſts are grown ſo impudent of late, as to charge the Proteſtants integrity of rebellion, and rebellious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and excuſe their own rebellious principles: As in a Treatiſe, intituled, <hi>Philanax Anglicus,</hi> dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> But <hi>Peter du Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> hath learnedly anſwered it. And truly herein they deal with us as <hi>Verres</hi> did with <hi>Tully: Verres</hi> himſelf was a very notorius thief, and knew that <hi>Cicero</hi> had much againſt him in that kind, and therefore he kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhly and impudently calls <hi>Cicero</hi> the thief firſt, though a very true man and noble Orator. It is juſt ſo in this caſe. Now I pray, what caſe may both King and Kingdom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be in, if Papiſts get any ſtrength or power? Have
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:106559:278"/> they not given infinit proofs both of old and late, of their rebellious diſpoſition and treaſonable practiſes?</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Containing ſome instances in particular of the barbarous, and inhumane cruelty of Papiſts to Proteſtants, where they had the power over them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Have hitherto ſhown that both the principles and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes of Papiſts, tend to treaſons, rebellions, war, and blood-ſhed: I ſhal in this Section, to detect their cruelty, give ſome inſtances in particular of their barbarous &amp; inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane cruelty to Proteſtants, where ever they get power &amp; authority, or the upper-hand over them. This is ſo well known, that none that knows any thing of Hiſtory are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it. Ought ever the ſad and deplorable caſe of <hi>England</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time to be forgotten, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſoul behoved to be ruined by Idolatry, or elſe the body to be burnt in a fire? This was an unanſwerable <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma,</hi> either ſoul or body muſt periſh. How many hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreds of Martyrs were burnt in one year all the Countrey over.</p>
               <p>Their inhumane cruelties executed on Proteſtants, are ſo many and terrible, that they would make up many Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, and make the hair to ſtand, and the ears to tingle. What greater torments are imaginable then is uſed in the Inquiſition of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> as it is deſcribed by <hi>M. Clerk</hi> in his Martyrologie? But that the Reader may know <hi>ex ungue leonem,</hi> their cruel and inhumane carriage to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, I ſhal ſet down a few inſtances.</p>
               <p>I ſhal begin with the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Meinerus</hi> Preſident of <hi>Oppede anno.</hi> 1545. raiſed war, &amp; coming to <hi>Cabriers,</hi> in which there were only 60. poor ſick peſants, who offered to open the gates and quite the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:106559:278"/> leaving all their goods behind them; but he entering the town cauſed all the men to be brought in a field and to be cut in pieces: The ſouldiers ſtriving who ſhould ſhow the beſt manhood in cutting of heads, arms and leggs. The women he cauſed to be locked in a barn with much ſtraw, and ſo put fire to it, where many women great with child were burnt. One ſouldier moved with pitie, opening a hole in the wall that ſome of them might come out, <hi>Oppede</hi> made them to be beaten back to the fire with picks and halberts: ſome of them that came forth, he ſlew with his own hands, ripping open their bellies, ſo that their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren came forth, whom he trod with his feet. It is too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to tell the helliſh and unparalleled cruelties that he uſed upon that people. See <hi>Sleydans Commentaries,</hi> and <hi>M. Clerks Martyrology, pag.</hi> 133. Another inſtance of their inhumane cruelty was in <hi>Italy anno</hi> 1560. in <hi>Calabria:</hi> where 88. Proteſtants being ſhut up in a priſon, the executioner cometh in, taketh out one and blind-foldeth him, and ſo leads him forth to a large place adjoyning, where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to kneel down, he cuts his throat, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him half dead, he takes his butchers knife all bloody, and goeth back to the reſt; ſo leading one after another, he diſpatched them all. This was ſuch a ſad ſpectacle, that he that writes of it, could not repeat it without tears. See <hi>Clerks Matyr. pag.</hi> 238.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhal be the Maſſacre of <hi>Paris, anno</hi> 1572. where when the Papiſts could not get the Proteſtants ſubdued by warr, they conclud a peace: And for ſecurity of it, the King gives his own ſiſter to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and all the Proteſtants are invited to the marriage: But in the mean time, the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> is poyſoned and dies, and upon <hi>Bartholomews</hi> day, <hi>anno</hi> 1672. the gates were ſhut (under pretence of ſearching for one that
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:106559:279"/> ſhot the Admiral, but really to keep all the Proteſtants within the Citie) and they came in firſt and killed the Admiral, and threw his dead body into the ſtreets, and ſent his head as a preſent to the Pope: And then to work they went, and ſlew that night, and the two dayes follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing to the number of ten thouſand in <hi>Paris.</hi> In this maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre their cruelty was ſo great, that they ſpared not young children in the cradle, nor infants in their mothers wombs, ſo that the ſtreets were covered with mangled bodies, gates and doors filled with blood, ſhoutings and howlings of the murderers, mixed with the cryes and groans of the dying; the breaking open of doors and windows, with the noiſe of guns and piſtols, all which made an helliſh noiſe: multitudes of dead bodies were thrown into the river, which was dyed red with their blood: preſently after the King ſending letters to <hi>Meaux, Troys, Orleans, Angiers, Roan, Tholouſe, Bourdeaux,</hi> and other places, where they murdered all the Proteſtants moſt barbarouſly and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely, and caſt out their dead bodies naked without the honor of burial, or threw them in the water, ſo that the rivers were dyed with their blood. The number that were maſſacred in <hi>France</hi> in a few weeks, amounted to thirty thouſand and above. Whoſoever deſires to hear a more full Relation of the miſchievous and horrid cruelty uſed in this Maſſacre, let them read <hi>Fox his Acts and Monuments, Vol. III. and Clerks Martyrology, p.</hi> 310. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next inſtance I ſhal give, ſhal be of their perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Valtoline, anno</hi> 1620. where ſetting upon the people as they were at Sermon, not dreading any ſuch thing, they murdered them all, not regarding ſex nor age: After which, they marched to <hi>Sanders,</hi> where the Papiſts in that place hearing of their coming, went to the Juſtice, proteſting that they ſhould guard him from danger, and that they would not permit ſuch villanies to be committed
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:106559:279"/> among them then did they arm themſelves, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of defending and ſecuring the Proteſtants; who tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to their promiſes; mixed themſelves among them to ſtand to their own defence. But they treacherouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed them, and joyned with the other Papiſts in murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them all whereever they met with them. Their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was monſtrous for they put a gag in the mouth of ſome, and then filled their mouth with powder, and put fire to it, which tore their head miſerably. Some had their mouthes ſlit up to their ears others had the fleſh cut from their faces, others were ſlaſhed in other parts of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy till they died, and others were often put to the ſtrapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, and then hewen in pieces.</p>
               <p>The next inſtance is more recent and freſh in memory, in the late warrs in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſince <hi>anno</hi> 1630. where the <hi>Sweds</hi> poſſeſſed of a town, called <hi>Paſewalk,</hi> the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts took it by ſtorm, beat, killed and drave out the <hi>Sweds;</hi> and not content therewith, they fell to torturing of the Towns men, raviſhing women and girles in the open ſtreets, and Church-yard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea women in child bed; where they killed the men, fired their houſes, and burnt many in them. Thurſt ſtraw into cellars where children were hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and ſo burnt and ſmothered them. Then they burnt the Churches, and maſſacred the Miniſters, and at laſt burnt down the whole Town.</p>
               <p>The like cruelty was uſed againſt the city of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> famous for Religion, which being taken by <hi>Tilly anno</hi> 1631. was in twelve hours ſpace wholly turned into aſhes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept 139 houſes: No mercy was ſhown to any age, ſex, or condition; about twenty thouſand perſons were ſlain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> burnt and ſmothered to death; ſix thouſand were drowned in the river: Ladies and Gentle-women like beaſts were yoked together, and led about the Countrey, and driven into woods to be raviſhed; and ſuch as reſiſted, were ſtript
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:106559:280"/> ſtark naked, whipt, had their ears cropt, and ſo were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned off.</p>
               <p>The Popiſh army having taken the town of <hi>Hoxter anno</hi> 1634. they ſpared neither man, woman nor child, moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanely butchering, and hewing in pieces all, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of age, ſex or condition; and what the ſword could not ſpoil, they cauſed the fire to conſume, and the dead corps they caſt into the river <hi>Weſer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their rage was ſo great againſt the profeſſors of the Goſpel, that neither <hi>Turks</hi> nor <hi>Heathens</hi> did ever exceed them. In <hi>Saxony, Tillies</hi> ſouldiers tortured the Proteſtants, by half ſtrangling them, and preſſing their thumbs with wheels. In <hi>Pomeran</hi> they forced the people to eat their own excrements; and if they refuſed, they thruſt them down their throat, whereby ſome of them were choked. They tyed about the heads of ſome, ſtrong matches or cords, and with ſhort truncheons twiſted them while blood came out of their eyes, ears, and noſes, yea ſometimes till their eyes ſtarted out of their heads: to others they tyed burning matches between their fingers, yea, to their eyes, ears, noſes, tongues, cheeks, breaſts, leggs, and ſecret parts; yea, ſuch parts as nature hideth, they either ſtuffed with gun-powder, or hung bags of powder to them, and ſo giving fire to it, in an horrible manner they burſt their bellies, and killed them: with bodkins they made holes, or with knives they cut the skin and fleſh of many. They drew ſtrings and cords through the fleſhie parts of ſome, and through the muſcles of their thighs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leggs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> arms, &amp;c. or through their noſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ears, lips, &amp;c. Some they hung up in the ſmoke, drying them with ſmal fires, and ſometimes refreſhing them with ſmal drink or water, taking care leſt in their torments they ſhould die too ſoon. Some they put into hot ovens, roaſting or ſmothering of them there. Some they roaſted with fires of ſtraw: ſome they ſtiffled,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:106559:280"/> ſtrangled or hanged, and this was a great favor, ſo ſoon to rid them out of pain. Of many they bound their hands and feet, that the blood ſpitted out of their fingers and toes ends. Of ſome they tyed their hands and feet back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards together, ſtopping their mouthes with clouts, to hinder them from praying. Some they hung up with ropes faſtened to their privy parts; and hearing their cryes, ſtrove by their roarings to drown their cryes, as in ſport. Many they drew up on high, hanging great weights at their feet, to pull their bodies out of joint. Of ſome they plained their faces with chiſſels. Some men they openly gelded in preſence of their wives &amp; children. The mouthes of ſome they ſet wide open with gags, and then powred down their throats ſtinking water, urine, and other liquid things, till they grew ſick, and their bellies ſwelled like tuns, whereby they died leaſurely with greater torment. Down the throats of ſome they violently thruſt knotted clouts, &amp; then with a ſtring pulled them up again, whereby they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed their bowels, &amp; put them to miſerable torment, in ſo much as ſome were made dumb, others deaf, others blind, and others lame. If the husband intreated for his wife, or the wife for the husband, they would take the interceſſor, and torture him in the ſame manner before the others eyes; and when any of theſe poor creatures in their torments or agonies of death, called and cryed unto God for mercy, they would command and ſeek to force them to pray and cry unto the Devil. Yea their deviliſhneſs proceeded ſo far, that they ſtudied to find out new and unheard-of torments. Some they bound, hung up and ſawed off their leggs; of others they rubbed off the fleſh of their leggs to the very bones: of others they tyed the arms backward, and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them up by theſe diſtorted parts, many they drew through the ſtreets of the citie ſtark naked, then brake and wounded them with axes and hammers; &amp; generally uſed
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:106559:281"/> them with ſuch barbarous cruelty that many begged to be ſhot or ſlain inſtantly, rather then to live and be partakers of ſuch miſeries. Rapts and raviſhings they committed beyond all humane modeſty: maids and matrons, wives and widows they forced and violated without diſtinction; yea, in the preſence of their parents, husbands and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors; yea, women great with child, and others in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, their beaſtlineſs was ſuch, that no pen can write it, no faith can believe it.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Heſſen</hi> land they took diverſe poor women, ſome mad, ſome dumb, ſome lame, and tying up their coats about their ears, ſo uſed them as a modeſt pen cannot expreſs. In <hi>Pomeran</hi> they took the faireſt maids, and raviſhed them before their parents faces, making them ſing Pſalms the while: One beautiful maid being hid by her parents in a dung-hill, they found her out, had their pleaſure of her, then cut her in pieces, and hung up her quarters in the Church; yea very girls of ten years old and under, they raviſhed, till ſome of them died. Vertuous and chaſte wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men they would threaten to kill, or throw their children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, if they would not yeeld to their luſts. Divers maids and women to avoid their luſts have leapt into ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and wells, and ſome have otherwiſe killed themſelves: and that which was never before heard-of, they did not only violate ſickly and weak maids and women till they died, but committed the like filthineſs with the dead corps. Who deſires to ſee more of this, let him peruſe <hi>Clerks Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrology, pag.</hi> 275 <hi>&amp; ſeqq.</hi>

               <p>The laſt inſtance of the unſpeakable ruine and miſery of Proteſtants under the mercileſs rage of Papiſts, where they are maſters, is a home-bred one in our own days, and freſh in memory, and of our own brethren, to wit, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in that late perſecution raiſed by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts againſt them, <hi>anno</hi> 1642. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:106559:281"/> called, <hi>The Iriſh rebellion.</hi> To make a full Relation of their horrid and barbarous cruelty, it would fill a whole Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume it ſelf, there being ſeveral Volumes written on that ſubject. I ſhal only name ſome few particulars. And firſt, when their plot was ripe, the Prieſts gave the Sacrament unto divers of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> upon condition that they ſhould neither ſpare man, woman, nor child of the Proteſtants, ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it was very meritorious to waſh their hands in their blood. One <hi>Halligan</hi> a Prieſt, read an excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt all theſe that from thenceforth ſhould relieve or harbor any <hi>Engliſh, Scots,</hi> or <hi>Welſch</hi> Proteſtants, or give them alms at their doors, whereby many were famiſhed to death. The Friers with tears exhorted them not to ſpare any of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> They openly profeſſed that they held it as lawful to kill a Proteſtant, as to kill a ſheep or a dog. One of their Prieſts ſaid, that it was no more pity or conſcience to take the lives or eſtats from them, then to take a bone out of a dogs mouth.</p>
               <p>The day before this Maſſacre was to begin, the Prieſts gave the people a free diſmiſs at Maſs, with free liberty to go out and take poſſeſſion of all their lands: as alſo to ſtrip, rob and ſpoyl them of all their goods and cattel, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants being as they told them, worſe then dogs; for they were Devils, and ſerved the Devil, and therefore the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſuch was <hi>a meritorious act,</hi> and a rare preſervative againſt the pains of Purgatory; for that the bodies of ſuch of them as died in the quarrel, ſhould not be cold before their ſouls ſhould aſcend up into heaven, they ſhould not fear the pains of Purgatory. And that cauſed ſome of them to boaſt, after they had murdered many, that they knew that if they ſhould die preſently, they ſhould go ſtraight to heaven.</p>
               <p>When this perſecution firſt began, many of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-men perſwaded many of their Proteſtant neighbors to
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:106559:282"/> bring their goods and cattel to them, and they would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them; and gave deep oaths and proteſtations to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that if they would deliver their goods, they would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them, with their wives and children, to depart the Countrey: yet having got their goods, they murdered ſome of them; others they ſtript ſtark naked, man, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and child, and ſo turned them out of doors; not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them ſo much as to ſhelter themſelves in buſhes, or in the woods. And they prohibited any of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> under great penalties, to give them any relief: And their deſign was, that theſe whom they would not cruelly murder in cold blood, might miſerably periſh through cold, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and want: And therefore when any got any rags to cover their nakedneſs, they ſtript them again and again, and drave them to the wild woods, in froſt and ſnow, ſo that many of them ſtarved, and fell down dead on the high wayes. Others that got to any <hi>Engliſh</hi> town, died ſo ſoon as they came there, by reaſon of the cold and famine ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the way. But theſe were but the beginnings of ſorrows; for they fell on and murdered in cold blood, ſome at plough, others in their houſes, others travelling in the way without provocation.</p>
               <p>In the Caſtle of <hi>Liſgool</hi> there were about 152. perſons conſumed with fire. At the Caſtle of <hi>Monea</hi> were an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſlain together. All that was in the Caſtle of <hi>Tullah,</hi> were all cruelly murdered, after the Caſtle was yeelded upon compoſition, and faithful promiſes of fair quarter.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Liſſenkea</hi> they hanged and killed above an hundred of the <hi>Scots</hi> Proteſtants: Some they cauſed upon hopes of life, to hear Maſs, and to ſwear never to alter from it, and preſently thereafter hanged or killed them.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Portendoun-bridge</hi> they drave a thouſand perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the river, and drowned them all; yea in that County they drowned four thouſand perſons, driving them to the
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:106559:282"/> river: and if any were ſlack in their pace, they pricked them forward with their ſwords and picks: and to terrifie the reſt, they killed ſome, and wounded others: and if any eſſayed to ſwim to the ſhore, they ſtood and ſhot at them. Some they gave paſſes, and ſent of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> with them, under the pretence of ſafe-conducting them, while they came to ſome place fit for execution, where they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther murdered or drowned them.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Armach, Onel</hi> got together all the Proteſtants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, pretending to conduct them to <hi>Colrain;</hi> but before they were gone a days journey they were all murdered, and ſo were many others, though they had <hi>Oneals</hi> prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. In <hi>Armach</hi> town there were 500. perſons murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and drowned. In <hi>Kilmore</hi> all the inhabitants were ſtript and maſſacred, being 200. families. The whole County was a common butchery, where many thouſands periſhed in a ſhort time, by ſword, famine, fire, water, and all other cruel manner of deaths that rage and malice could invent: yea, their cruelty was ſo great, that they would not grant them ſo much liberty as to pray before they murdered them. Some when they were kneeling and praying, they would cut off their head. When ſome on their knees beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged but leave to pray before they were ſlain, they would bid them bequeath their ſouls to the Devil. Others would ask them, Why do you deſire to pray, your ſouls are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready with the Devil? and ſo would immediatly ſlaughter them. Some they put in filthy dungeons, full of dirt and myre, and there clapping bolts on their legs, ſuffered them to periſh at leaſure. Some they barbarouſly mangled, and left them languiſhing upon the high ways, crying out but for ſo much mercy as to be diſpatched out of their pain. Some they buried alive. Some when they were half han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, they caſt into pits, covering them with a little earth, where they ſent out moſt lamentable groans for a good
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:106559:283"/> while after. Some they hacked, ſlaſhed, and wounded and then put and kept them under with ſtones, where they lay languiſhing and groaning, while their own wives ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped their breath with handkerchiefs to put them out of pain. Some they buried alive, yet ſo as their pityful cryes were heard afar off. Some were deadly wounded, and ſo were hung by the chocks upon tenter hooks. Some with ropes about their necks, were drawn through the water. Some with ropes about their middles, were drawn through woods and bogs. Some were hung up by the arms, and then with their ſwords they made experiment how many blows an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant would endure ere he died. Some had their bellies ript up, and ſo were left with their guts running about their heels.</p>
               <p>Many women great with child they hung up, then ript their bellies and let the infants fall out, and gave them to be devoured of dogs and ſwine. Many children they took by the heels, and daſhed their brains out againſt a tree. Many they pucked and ſtabbed with their skeens, forks and ſwords, ſlaſhing, cutting and mangling them, in their heads, faces, breaſts, arms, and other parts yet killed them not, but left them wallowing in their blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to languiſh, ſtarve, and pine to death; and when they deſired them to kill them out of their pain, they refuſed; yet ſometimes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a day or two, they would daſh out their brains with ſtones or clubs, which they accounted as a great favor. In the cold weather many thouſands of Proteſtants of all ranks, ages and ſexes, being turned out ſtark naked, peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of cold and hunger Thouſands of others were drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, caſt into ditches, bogs, and turff-pits. Multitudes were incloſed in houſes, which being ſet on fire, they were burnt miſerably. Some that lay ſick of fevers, they drew out of their beds, and hanged them. Some men, women and children, they drove into boggy pits: and if any of
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:106559:283"/> them endeavored to get out, they knockt them on their heads. Some aged men and women, they forced them to carry their own children to the river, where they were drowned; yea ſome children were compelled unnaturally to be the executioners of their own parents. Wives were forced to help to hang their own husbands, and mothers to caſt their own children into the water, after all which themſelves were murdered In <hi>Slego</hi> they forced a young man to kill his own father, and then hanged him up. In another place, they forced a woman to kill her husband, then cauſed her ſon to kill her, and then immediatly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the ſon: and this they did that they might deſtroy both ſoul and body: yea, the women were as bloody as the men, killing women and children; yea, they boyled a child of twelve years of age in a caldron: and in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the women ſtoned the <hi>Engliſh</hi> women to death. In ſome places they plucked out the eyes, and cut off the hands of the Proteſtants, and ſo turned them out into the fields to wander till they periſhed.</p>
               <p>Neither did their cruelty end with the lives of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, but extended after death, to the denying burial to their carkaſſes, caſting ſome into ditches, leaving others to be devoured of ravenous beaſts and fowls; yea ſome that had been formerly buried, they digged up, and left them as dung upon the face of the earth; and they vowed if any parents, or wives digged graves to bury their husbands or children in, they ſhould be buried therein themſelves. Yea, they abuſed and triumphed over the dead; for at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> when they had committed many cruel murders, they brought ſeven Proteſtant heads, among which was the head of a Miniſter, all which they ſet on the Market Croſs, on a Market day, triumphing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſlaſhing, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling of them, and putting a gag into the Miniſters mouth, they ſlit up his cheeks to his ears, and laying a leaf of the
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:106559:284"/> Bible before it, they bid him preach, for his mouth was wide enough. When they put many Proteſtants in hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſet fire in them, and burnt them, they exulted over them, imitating in ſcorn their cryes, and ſaying, <hi>O how ſweetly do they fry.</hi> Yea, they made their, boaſt how many Proteſtants they killed; yea, they burnt and blaſphemouſly abuſed the Bible. At <hi>Slego</hi> they put all the Proteſtants in the Goal, and about midnight they were all ſtript ſtark na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and there moſt cruelly and barbarouſly murdered, with ſwords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> axes, skeens: ſome of them being women great with child, their infants thruſt out their arms and legs at their wounds; after which execrable murders, they laid the dead naked bodies of the men upon the dead na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked bodies of the women, in a moſt immodeſt poſture, where they left them while the next day, to be looked on as a delectable ſpectacle to the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About <hi>Dunganon</hi> were 316. Proteſtants in the like bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous manner murdered: about <hi>Charlmont</hi> above 510. about <hi>Tiron</hi> 250. One <hi>M. Crew,</hi> murdered 31. in one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: Two young villains murdered 140. poor women and children: An <hi>Iriſh</hi> women with her own hands mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered 45. At <hi>Portendown-bridge</hi> were drowned above 300. At <hi>Lawgh</hi> were drowned above 200. In another place 300. were drowned in one day. In the Pariſh of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamen</hi> there were murdered 1200. Proteſtants. In the County of <hi>Antrum</hi> they murdered 954. Proteſtants in one morning, and afterwards about 1200 more in that County. <hi>Sir Philem Oneal</hi> boaſted that he had ſlain above 600 at <hi>Garvagh,</hi> and that he had left neither man, woman, nor child alive in the Barrony of <hi>Munterlong.</hi> In other places he murdered above 2000. perſons in their houſes, above 12000, were ſlain in the high wayes, as they fled towards <hi>Down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not only the men, but alſo the boyes murdered Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:106559:284"/> for there were 15. Proteſtants all murdered in one night by a Popiſh boy of 14. years, who ſlew them with his skeen, they being impriſoned, and their feet in the ſtocks.</p>
               <p>Another of twelve years killed two women. An <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Papiſt woman killed ſeven men and women of her neighbors in one morning; and it was uſual for the Papiſts children to murder the Proteſtants children; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with their wooden ſwords, ſharp and heavy, they would venture upon people of riper years. An <hi>Engliſh</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who was newly delivered of two children, ſome of theſe vilains violently compelled her in great pains and ſickneſs, to riſe from her bed, and took one of the infants that was living, and daſhed his brains againſt the ſtones, and then threw him into the river. The like they did with many other infants. Many others they hanged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all pity; yea many young children they cut into quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and goblets. Eighteen <hi>Scots</hi> infants they hanged upon a clothiers tenter-hooks. One fat man they murdered, and made candles of his greaſs. Another <hi>Scottiſh</hi> man they ript up his belly, and an end of his ſmal guts tyed it to a tree, and forced him round about it, till he had drawn them all out of his body, ſaying they would try whither a <hi>Scots</hi>-man or a dogs guts were the longer. They took one <hi>M. Watſon,</hi> and cutting two colops out of his but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks, they roaſted him alive. They ript up a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man great with child cut the child out of her womb, and ſo left it crawling on her body. They uſed alſo to ſend their children abroad in troups, armed with long watles and whips, wherewith they uſe to beat dead mens bodies about the privy members, till they beat them off. They brake the back-bone of a young youth, and ſo left him in the fields; and ſome days after, he was found, having like a beaſt, eaten all the graſs round about him; yet neither then
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:106559:285"/> would they kill him outright, but removed him to a place of better paſture.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many mo cruelties were uſed among the poor Proteſtants: who deſires to ſee their monſtrous, and more then barbarous cruelties at more length, let him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe a book written on purpoſe, called <hi>Irelands tears, and M. Clerks Martyrology, from pag.</hi> 347. <hi>to pag.</hi> 369. which books never Papiſt could convince of falſhood.</p>
               <p>Now leſt any ſhould think this was a natural quarrel that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had againſt the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Anſ. Certainly that could not be, becauſe they were no more merciful to the <hi>Scottiſh,</hi> whom all acknowledge to be of their own Nation. 2. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſts were no whit inferior, but rather exceeded the natural <hi>Iriſh,</hi> in their cruelty againſt the Proteſtants that lived among them within the Pale, being never ſatisfied with their blood till they had ſeen the laſt drop thereof.</p>
               <p>Now was ever ſuch inhumane cruelty heard or read of among <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> as they exerciſed againſt the poor Proteſtants, who never provoked them thereto, yea, that had always lived peaceably with them, adminiſtring help and pitie to them in diſtreſs, cheriſhing them as friends, and loving neighbors? yet they ſhewed them no favor nor pity: Alace! who can conceive the fears, terrors, anguiſh, bitterneſs and perplexity that ſeazed upon the hearts of the poor Proteſtants, finding themſelves ſo ſuddenly ſurprized without remedy, and inextricably wrapt up in all kind of outward miſeries, which could poſſibly by man be inflicted upon humane creatures? What ſighs and groans, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and aſtoniſhment? What ſchricks, cryes, and bitter lamentations of wives, children, ſervants and friends, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and weeping, finding themſelves without all hope of deliverance from their preſent miſeries? How inexorable were their torments without all bowels of compaſſion? The moſt barbarous Nation never uſed more cruelty, then
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:106559:285"/> they did upon the poor Proteſtants all the land over. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in this maſſacre deſtroyed by ſeveral ſorts of torments ſeveral hundred thouſands: for there were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up upon oath 150000. put to ſeveral ſorts of death in the Province of <hi>Ulſter.</hi> What the number of the ſlain was in the three other Provinces, is not on record, but certainly it was very great. As among other things, the <hi>Remonſtrance of the diſtreſſed Protestants in Munſter,</hi> ſet down in <hi>M. Clarks Martyrology</hi> evidenceth.</p>
               <p>By all that is ſaid, I hope it is ſufficiently proved, that the principles and practiſes of Papiſts are bloody, treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, cruel and inhumane; yet they are not only ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to deny this, calling it a loud ſlander, but alſo to charge Proteſtants of integrity (as they call us) with trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and rebellious principles. Whereas we in all our Confeſſions acknowledge that Magiſtracy is an ordinance of God, and that <hi>every ſoul is to be ſubject to the higher powers,</hi> and that fidelity and obedience is due to them, in, and for the Lord. The publick Confeſſions of our Churches, plead for this. See the <hi>Augustan, French, Belgick, Helvetick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemian, Saxonick, Suevick, Scottiſh, Engliſh,</hi> and the <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi> Confeſſions.</p>
               <p>Did ever any of our Divines teach any ſuch doctrine? or to commit any ſuch practiſes as Papiſts teach? Do we not all hold that an oath is <hi>ſtrictiſſimi juris,</hi> of moſt ſtrict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, and can be diſpenſed by none under heaven, and ought to be kept even to hereticks, infidels, or any other whatſoever? We acknowledge that Church-men, as well as others, are ſubject to the Magiſtrat, according to the Word of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. None of us did ever teach, that the Pope, or any Church-man may dethrone Kings, and alien at their Crowns to others; neither do we teach that Church men are looſed from the poſitive laws of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Kings; much leſs do we hold, that the Pope may
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:106559:286"/> looſe all ſubjects from their oath of loyalty, and command that a Jeſuit ſtob, or poyſon a King, when he turneth ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Roman faith. Satan himſelf cannot charge us with theſe; therefore we intreat that none would hearken to the Author of <hi>Philanax Anglicus,</hi> or the like, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to traduce and calumniat us, as if the Proteſtants of integrity did teach and practiſe rebellion, &amp;c. Look to our Confeſſions and the approved writings of our Doctors, and to the practiſes of Proteſtants in the Kingdoms and Common-wealths where they live, and they will be forced to confeſs we own no ſuch doctrine. Who more loyal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects then the Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth? They owned them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aſſiſted and fought for them, when almoſt all others abandoned them? How faithful were our predeceſſors in <hi>Scotland</hi> to King <hi>James,</hi> they crowned him in his cradle, they preſerved him, owned and aſſiſted him, and made him a glory to <hi>Europe,</hi> for underſtanding, learning and wiſdom?</p>
               <p>I ſhal not inſiſt further on this, ſeeing <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi> hath learnedly vindicated the Reformed Churches from this falſe aſperſion hatched in hell, of purpoſe to alienat the affections of the Magiſtrat from us. But this only ſay, as we deſire to <hi>render to God the things that are Gods;</hi> ſo we deſire to <hi>render to Ceſar the things that are Ceſars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to conclud, Doth not the truth and honor of God, (which ought to be dearer to us then our own ſalvation) our own and poſterities welfare and ſafety in body, ſoul, and all that is near and dear to us, call us to conſider and ſeriouſly to lay to heart the increaſe and prevalency of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery? Since the Reformation, there was never generally more prevailing of Popery, and more hazard of being rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereby, then now, and yet never leſs ſenſe thereof, &amp; zeal againſt it. In former times, the leaſt appearance of the prevalency of Popery did alarm all, to deal according
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:106559:286"/> to their place and ſtation, moſt ſeriouſly, for ſuppreſſing thereof. I ſhal not inſiſt in ſhewing how zealous our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors in <hi>Scotland</hi> were againſt Popery, and how they left no mean uneſſayed for total extirpation thereof out of the land; nor how ready they were upon the leaſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any danger, to diſcover the danger, and petition and ſupplicat the Kings Majeſty and Eſtats of Parliament for remedy. For inſtance, when news came of the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Spaniſh Armado</hi> 1588. what faſting, praying, and humiliation was all the Land over; and all other means eſſayed for preventing that diſmal-like ſtroke? And <hi>anno</hi> 1592. when the plots of the Popiſh Lords, who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to bring in the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the Kingdom, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; what zeal and forwardneſs did all the Land ſhow for defence of the Reformed Religion, and ſuppreſſing of Popery? I will not, I ſay, inſiſt at large on theſe, ſeeing the Acts of our Parliaments (wherein there are ſo many excellent ſtatuts and laws made againſt Popery) and the Hiſtories of theſe times doth abundantly declare what ze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l and hatred all ranks and degrees had againſt that <hi>Romiſh</hi> Whoor. But I ſhal only make this inference. If they had ſuch love to the truth, and ſuch zeal againſt Antichriſt, who had not ſuch light, and were not ſo ſtrongly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as we are; ſhal they not ariſe in judgement againſt us, and condemn us? For ſhould not the truths of God be as precious to us, as to our predeceſſors? Are there not as many obligations lying upon us, as was upon them? Is not Popery that ſame damnable Antichriſtian idolatry now, that it was then? Why then are we ſo dreadfully lukewarm and indifferent, and ſo little zealous againſt it? Should we be ſilent when Chriſt ſuffers? If in any thing, and at any time we be obliged to confeſs him before men, and to contend earneſtly <hi>for the faith once delivered to the Saints;</hi> is it not in this thing, and at this time, when
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:106559:287"/> Antichriſt is endeavoring to rob us of the purity of the Goſpel, and to entangle us with the yoke of his Idolatry and ſuperſtition? Do we not ſee what we may expect, if Popery prevail, notwithſtanding of all their ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and fair and plauſible inſinuations.</p>
               <p>The maſſacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition,</hi> and their unheard-of cruelty in <hi>Ireland</hi> to our own fleſh and blood, together with the <hi>Marian</hi> days in <hi>England,</hi> ought never to be forgotten by us, but alwayes raiſe in us a perfect deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, and holy zeal and indignation againſt that Scarlet Whoor. What may we expect if Popery prevail, but that ſad <hi>Dilemma,</hi> either to be burnt at a ſtake, or looſe our ſouls and bodies eternally: for the portion of theſe <hi>that worſhip the Beaſt, and receive his mark,</hi> is to be <hi>caſten in that lake that burneth night and day, Rev.</hi> 14.10.11.</p>

               <p>NOw, although we can expect nothing but either loſs of life, and all that is near and dear to us, or to looſe our ſouls eternally, if Popery prevail: yet how little concerned are we in theſe matters? How luke warm and indifferent are we in this age and generation, as to any Religion? How few are they that are ſtirred up to deal with God by prayer and ſupplication, for continuing of the Goſpel in purity with us, and to lay ſeriouſly to heart the abounding iniquity of theſe days, that may juſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord to give us up to the tyranny of Antichriſt? It is true many apprehend no hazard from Antichriſt, and think that all the noyſe that is made of the prevalency of Popery, is without any real ground and cauſe: But let ſuch think what they pleaſe, yet really our hazard is not ſo little as is apprehended, if we conſider the diligence, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and vigilancy of Antichriſt upon the one hand, and
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:106559:287"/> the lightneſs, unſtability, lukewarmneſs, and <hi>Gallio</hi>-like temper of this generation, together with the dreadful evils whereby the Lord is provoked to remove the candleſtick, and give us up to ſtrong deluſions to believe lies, on the o her hand.</p>

<pb n="510" facs="tcp:106559:288"/> Coutzens</hi> a Jeſuit of <hi>Mentz,</hi> a great Politician, wrote a great Book of Politicks, and in his 2. <hi>Book, chap.</hi> 18. he gives ſeveral rules to his fellow Jeſuits, for cheating a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Reformed Religion by ſlight of hand and <hi>leger de main.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is, <hi>To proceed as Muſicians do in tuning their instruments, who proceed gradually, ſtraining their ſtrings with a gentle hand, and ſetting them up by little and little. Or as Phyſicians do in curing diſeaſes, who abate noxious humors by degrees and pauſes.</hi> So Jeſuits will not diſcover all their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine at firſt, but bring in corruptions by degrees.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond is, <hi>To preſs the examples and practiſes of ſome eminent men, as a good mean to draw on the reſt.</hi> Thus they cry out ſuch a Noble-man, or great man, hath em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, why may you not do the like?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third rule is, <hi>That Arch-hereticks, and ſuch as are Teachers of hereſie</hi> (meaning the zealous Miniſters, and others that propagat and defend the Reformed Religion) <hi>must be baniſhed the Commonwealth at once, if it may ſafely be done; but if not, by degrees.</hi> This way they followed in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> baniſhing the Miniſters by degrees, and their great hatred is ſtill againſt the Miniſtery.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His fourth rule is, <hi>That theſe that are adverſaries to true Religion</hi> (to wit, Popery) <hi>be put from their dignities, places and offices, and not truſted with power or publick em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</hi> Hence Jeſuits inſinuat themſelves much, ordinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on States-men, and theſe who have the diſpoſal of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of truſt, and uſe all means to keep zealous Proteſtants from truſt and power.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth rule is, <hi>To make the Protestant Religion odious, by laying load upon ſuch tenets as are moſt ſubject to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhest conſtruction; and rendering the perſons of theſe that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them contemptible.</hi> Hence it is the great work of
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:106559:288"/> Papiſts to raiſe calumnies on our Religion, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors thereof: for example, That we make God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſin; revive old condemned hereſies, &amp;c. and they have raiſed a great heap of lies, reproches and calumnies upon our firſt Reformers, <hi>Luther, Calvin, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. His ſixth rule is, <hi>To foment the quarrels that are among Proteſtants, and ſtrengthen the party that is neareſt a complyance with Rome.</hi> So any difference that is among us, they caſt oyl to the fire, and play their own game thereby.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſeventh rule is, <hi>That all privat Conventicles, and publick meetings muſt be forbidden.</hi> This they did in <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia;</hi> for the Pope and his Cardinals had a conſultation what they ſhould do with the <hi>Bohemians</hi> and <hi>Germans?</hi> It was reſolved, that ſeeing their former ſtrong purges which they had uſed to expell heretical humors, had not proved effectual, they therefore reſolved to take a milder courſe; and in proſecution thereof, they uſed ſeveral ſtratagems; one whereof was, to prohibit all meetings of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</p>
               <p n="8">8. His eight rule is, <hi>Severity of laws and puniſhments, to compel the obstinat unto duty, and yet the rigor of the law muſt be ſlowly drawn out, and not againſt all; but only ſuch as be moſt dangerous: For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>although compulſory refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation will do no good to old ſtanders, yet it will render the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſort Catholicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The ninth and laſt rule is, <hi>That ſuch as are in authority, and have the publick management of Eccleſiastical affairs, do religiouſly practiſe and maintain integrity and purity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> From all which we may ſee that we may be in great hazard of being ruined by the policies of Prieſts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits.</p>
               <p n="2">II. But, alace! although they be nothing abated in their activity and diligence to undo and ruine us; yet we are wonderfully abated of our zeal and hatred of them and
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:106559:289"/> their doctrine. Our predeceſſors had their zeal raiſed very high againſt them, and were very active and diligent in reſiſting and oppoſing them; but how indifferent and luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm are we in this generation? ſome of a <hi>Caſſandro-Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> temper, that are for complying and uniting with them; others of <hi>Gallios</hi> temper, that is not much concerned in any Religion, if they can ſecure their own civil concernments: others are ignorant, light, unſtable, and unfixed in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion; ſo there are but very few that have any ſenſe of the evil or danger of Popery upon their ſpirits.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But that which may moſt of all alarm us, is our hainous provocations and tranſgreſſions, whereby the Lord is dreadfully provoked to give up with us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move our candleſtick out of its place, and to give us up to the deluſions of Antichriſt; may we not tremble for fear of this, if we conſider what God hath done for us, and what requital we have given him.</p>
               <p>God hath done many wonderful things for us in theſe lands, both of old and of late; for according to the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made of old to his Son, <hi>That he would give the heathen for his inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion, &amp; that the iſles ſhould wait for his law,</hi> was graciouſly pleaſed many hundred years ago, &amp; early after the riſing of the Sun of righteouſneſs, to give light unto the <hi>Gentils,</hi> to pity our fore-fathers then mancipated to the ſervice of Idols, which were not God, and viſite them with the light of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and bleſſed Goſpel; which he ſo bleſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in a ſhort time both King, Nobility, and people embraced it, and the whole Nation became Chriſtians, and for ſundry genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the land was bleſſed and honored of God with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Profeſſors and Paſtors famous for learning, holineſs and piety; and for their pains and ſucceſs in the work of the Goſpel, both at home &amp; abroad, until at laſt, with the reſt of moſt of the Chriſtian Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> it was involved
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:106559:289"/> in the darkneſs of Popiſh ſuperſtition and idolatry; to which the greateſt part were in bondage for many years: but there was a remnant, who kept their garments pure, and did not receive the mark of the Beaſt. Likewiſe when the Lord with a high hand and a mighty ſtretched-out arm did diſcover (by his ſervant <hi>Luther,</hi> and other worthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments whom he raiſed up) the abominations of that Whoor, he was graciouſly pleaſed in the dayes of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to redeem us from that Antichriſtian tyranny, and ſuperſtition and idolatry, and again to cauſe the light of the Goſpel ſhine among us; which mauger many oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he hath alwayes kept among us in purity to this day, expecting that we ſhould have brought forth the fruits thereof. But, alace! was ever a people followed with ſo much mercy; and gave ſuch evil recompence and unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable dealing to the Lords goodneſs, as we have done? Was ever more wickedneſs and prophanity among a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then is among us? Is not many very ignorant of GOD, and the way of ſalvation holden out in the Goſpel, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of all the pains that have been taken on them? Hath not prophanity, like <hi>Jordan,</hi> overflowed all its banks? I know not if there be ſo much ſwearing, drinking, whoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, blaſphemy, revelling, &amp;c. among Heathens, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of the Goſpel, as is among us. And is there not an univerſal almoſt contempt and undervaluing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and a deriding and mocking of Religion? Many are now grown ſo Atheiſtical, that they have caſten off all fear of GOD, Heaven, Hell, or regard of ſalvation, or damnation. Did GOD threaten to remove <hi>Epheſus</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick out of its place, becauſe of falling from her firſt love? And ought we not to tremble, leſt ours be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Did he threaten to ſpew <hi>Laodicea</hi> out of his mouth, becauſe of lukewarmneſs, and being neither cold nor hot; and can we conceive that he will ſpare us who are ſo
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:106559:290"/> univerſally lukewarm? Did GOD cut off the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were the natural branches, for their unfruitfulneſs, and other ſins: and ſuppoſe we that he will ſpare us? Is it enough to conſtitut a Reformed Proteſtant to caſt off the idolatry error and ſuperſtition of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not alſo to reform from the prophanity and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that reigns in the world; and to uſe all endeavors to have our converſation according to the Goſpel? For the great end of the appearing of the grace of GOD in the Goſpel, is to teach us to deny all ungodlineſs and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, in this preſent life, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Magdeburg</hi> Century-Writers (<hi>in praefat. ad Cent.</hi> 5.) obſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that before Antichriſt came to his hight, and infected the Chriſtian world with his idolatry, theſe follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing iniquities reigned every where. <hi>Verbi Divini con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptus, &amp;c. The contempt and depravation of the Word of the LORD: the inventing and defending of corruptions: the toleration and reverencing of ſeducers: the perſecution and oppreſſion of faithful Teachers: and finally, Epicuriſm and colluſion with the ungodly: upon which followed, as a deſerved puniſhment, the ſubstitution of humane traditions, in place of GODS Word: the giving liberty and rewards to impostors: the hindering the confeſſion of the truth: the giving over to a reprobat ſenſe, and to blindneſs; and being deceived by the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious illuſions of the Devil, which puniſhments were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with idolatry, ſuperſtitious worſhip, Phanatick and more then Ethnick furies; alſo civil puniſhments and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on the Kingdoms and Common-wealths, in which theſe ſins did abound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Author of the Book, intituled, <hi>Conſideratio cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Belli Bohemici,</hi> points out the abounding among them, of the ſubſequent ſins, as one main cauſe of the deſtruction of <hi>Bohemia</hi> by Antichriſt. <hi>The chief ſins</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>part.</hi> 2.
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:106559:290"/> 
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 24.) <hi>that abounded in Bohemia before its devaſtation, were (as the godly often confeſſed) ingratitude and unthankfulneſs for the Goſpel, and contempt of the Miniſtery, that they did not eſteem it as became: exceſs in meat and clothing, eſpecially in great perſons: oppreſſion of their ſubjects, and ſmal care of the poor: doing to their neighbor what they would not had them doing to them: remiſsneſs and ſlackneſs in diſcipline, and giving a licence to ſin: but eſpecially cold rifeneſs and lukewarmneſs, in reference to the intereſt of Christ, and defence and maintenance of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if God was ſo provoked by theſe above-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſins, that he gave up almoſt all the Chriſtian world to the deluſions of Antichriſt, and removed his Candleſtick from <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which was ſuch a famous Church, and had witneſſed for the truth againſt Antichriſt for ſo long a time; may we not tremble, leſt he be provoked to give up with us? Is not the Word and Ordinances much contemned and deſpiſed among us? Have not many errors and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions ſprung up, and like a flood overſpred many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in theſe Lands? Was there ever more ingratitude, and unthankfulneſs for the Goſpel, and contempt of the Miniſtery among a people, then is among us? Is not glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, drunkenneſs, vanity of apparel and oppreſſion, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Epidemick, among all ranks and degrees of perſons? Were ever any more coldrife and lukewarm in reference to the intereſts of Chriſt, then we are? Yea, we are guilty of many of theſe things, for which the Lord threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to depart, and to remove his Candleſtick, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we a little conſider ſome of the ſpecial ſins that the Lord threatneth with his removeal.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Ignorance of God, and of the neceſſary truths of the Goſpel, is threatned with his removeal, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Be inſtructed, O Jeruſalem! lest my ſoul depart from thee, &amp;c. Iſai.</hi> 27.11. <hi>It is a people of no underſtanding; therefore he that
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:106559:291"/> made them, will have no mercy on them: and he that formed them, will ſhow them no favor.</hi> Now for all the light of the Goſpel that hath ſhined among us theſe hundred years and above, the Word being line upon line, precept upon precept, &amp;c. yet what groſs and palpable ignorance is every where to be found; the generality of people igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant even of the fundamentals of Religion?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Barrenneſs and unfruitfulneſs under the Goſpel, is threatned with the removeal thereof, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.6 7. <hi>I looked for grapes, but behold wild grapes. And now go to, I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard; I will take away the hedge thereof, and it ſhal be eaten up: and breakdown the wall thereof, and it ſhal be troden down. And I will lay it waſte: it ſhal not be pruned, nor digged, &amp;c.</hi> The fig tree that was three years fruitleſs, is commanded to be cut down, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.7. <hi>And the earth that drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth nothing but thorns and thiſtles, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and near unto curſing, Heb.</hi> 6.8. Now, was ever people more rained upon then we? And yet is there any that is more barren and unfruitful then we are? Are not the moſt part of us empty vines, that bring forth fruit to themſelves? How few are there that the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation, hath taught to deny all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly; to be crucified to the fleſh, with the luſts and affections thereof, to have their converſation in heaven?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Slighting, loathing and wearying of the precious things of God, and of his Ordinances, is a ſin, for which the Lord threatens to remove from a people, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.4.5.6.9 11.12. <hi>Hear this, O ye that ſwallow up the needy, &amp;c. ſaying. When will the new Moon be gone that we may ſell corn: and the Sabbath, that we may ſet forth wheat, &amp;c.</hi> Verſ. 9. <hi>I will cauſe the Sun to go down at noon, and darken the earth in the clear day. And I will turn your feaſts into mourning, and
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:106559:291"/> all your ſongs to lamentations, &amp;c.</hi> And verſ. 11. <hi>I will ſend a famin in the land; not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the Word of the Lord. And they ſhal wander from ſea to ſea, and from the North even to the Eaſt; they ſhal run to and fro to ſeek the Word of the Lord, and ſhal not find it. Zech.</hi> 11.8. <hi>Their ſoul abhorred me: then ſaid I, I will not feed you; that that dieth, let it die.</hi> Now is not the wearying, deſpiſing, ſlighting and contemning of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt, ſo evident among us, that he that runs may read it?</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth ſin, for which the Lord threatens to give up with folk, is formality and lukewarmneſs; contenting themſelves with a form of godlineſs without the power thereof. 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10.11.12. <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved: and for this cauſe, God ſhal ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould believe a lie, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Laodicea</hi> is threatned for her lukewarmneſs, to be ſpewed out of Chriſts mouth, <hi>Rev</hi> 3.16. Now what age or generation could ever parallel this for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality and lukewarmneſs in the matters of God? And may we not be juſtly given up to the deluſions of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt?</p>
               <p n="5">5 A fifth ſin, is unbelief and diſobedience to the call of God in the Goſpel, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 9.17. <hi>My God will caſt them away, becauſe they did not hearken unto him: and they ſhal wander among the Nations.</hi> Was it not for this ſin, that the Lord upbraided thoſe Cities, wherein moſt of his mighty works were done, and threatens to bring deſolation on them? <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.21.22.23.24. Were not the <hi>Jews</hi> cut off for their unbelief? <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. And is there no ſad evidences and ſymptoms of this ſin every where? How few are they that have received Chriſt by faith, &amp; is endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring Goſpel-obedience? And may we not fear leſt the judgement of <hi>Chorazin, Capernaum</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> be ours?</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="518" facs="tcp:106559:292"/>6. A ſixth ſin, for which the Lord threatens to remove the Candleſtick, is falling from our firſt love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4 Now have we not declined, not only from the love and zeal which our fathers had; but alſo even from that love, zeal and diligence in duty that once we our ſelves had?</p>
               <p n="7">7. A ſeventh ſin, is ſtupidity and impenitency under all Gods diſpenſations, whether of mercy or judgement, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.5.6 7. And is not this ſin ſo manifeſt, that he that runs may read it? Who is ſmiting on his thigh, and ſaying, What have I done? How few are noticing what God is contending for, or laying their iniquities to heart?</p>
               <p>Several others might be inſtanced, but theſe may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſhow us what ground of fear we may have of Gods giving us up to the deluſions of Antichriſt: yea, is he not in a great meaſure departed from us? Hath he not ſore cracked, if not broken, the ſtaves of beauty and bands, our unity and authority? We are divided in his anger, and contempt is powred upon us. Is not the bleſſing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances much reſtrained? How few are converted and built up by the Goſpel? Yea, what deadneſs, decay and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering is upon all, even the Lords people? And how many are content to live without God, and ſuffer him to be gone?</p>
               <p>Now lay all theſe together, and we will ſee that the ground of fear is greater then is apprehended by many: Therefore let us be laying the hazard of the Church, and of our ſelves and poſterity to heart, and let us be ſtirring up our ſelves to deal with the Lord by mourning and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, prayer and ſupplications, for the turning away of his wrath, and for the powring out of his vials upon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. If ever there was a time wherein repentance and mourning for our ſins, and the ſins of the Land was called for, it is now: For are not our ſins very great? And is not the cry of them come up to heaven? And is not the
<pb facs="tcp:106559:292"/> Lord hearkning and hearing if any man will repent him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the evil of his doings, and ſay, What evil have I done For he is waiting to ſee what we will do, before he leave us altogether: For he hath in a great meaſure left us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. For are we not ſtricken with blindneſs, confuſion and aſtoniſhment, and trembling of heart? Is he not in a great meaſure departed from his Ordinances? For is not that light darkned, that life withered, that ſtrength aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that preſence evaniſhed, that tenderneſs gone, theſe influences withholden, that ſometimes were wont to be felt in Ordinances? Yea, is not prayer reſtrained and love waxed exceeding cold, and hardneſs of heart grown uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, delight in God and in his Word, and in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of godlineſs grown exceeding rare? Doth not God hide his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce from us, and anſwer us with terrible things in righteouſneſs? All which ſpeak, that the glory of the Lord is departed from the Temple to the threſhold. Let us therefore lay theſe things ſeriouſly to heart, and <hi>break up our fallow ground, and circumciſe our ſelves to the Lord, and take away the fore-skins of our hearts, leſt his fury break forth like fire and burn, that none can quench it, Jer.</hi> 4.3. For is he not crying, both by his Word and diſpenſations, <hi>Be inſtructed, O Jeruſalem! (O Britain!) leſt my ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thee, leſt I make thee deſolat, a land not inhabited? Jer.</hi> 6 8. Repentance and Reformation is only the mean to prevent our ruine: therefore let us be dealing with him who is the Prince exalted, to give repentance and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, for the powring out of that ſpirit upon the land. O! if we were all about this work! then there might yet be hope in <hi>Iſrael</hi> concerning us. The Lord who is rich in mercy, grant us mercy, ſo as to be ſtirred up to true mourning and repentance, and to be laying more ſeriouſly to heart, the grounds of his contention. Amen.</p>
